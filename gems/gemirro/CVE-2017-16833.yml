title: Stored XSS in "gemirro" via injection in Gemspec "homepage" value
date: 2017-07-11
description: |
  Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gemirro allows
  attackers to inject arbitrary web script via a crafted JavaScript URL
  in the "homepage" value of a ".gemspec" file.

  A ".gemspec" file must be created with a JavaScript URL in the homepage
  value. This can be used to build a gem for upload to the Gemirro server,
  in order to achieve stored XSS via the author name hyperlink.
