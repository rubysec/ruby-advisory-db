title: Cross-Site Scripting in Kaminari via `original_script_name` parameter
description: |-
  ### Impact
  There was a vulnerability in versions of Kaminari that would allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into pages with pagination links.

  For example, an attacker could craft pagination links that link to other domain or host:
  https://example.com/posts?page=4&original_script_name=https://another-host.example.com

  In addition, an attacker could also craft pagination links that include JavaScript code that runs when a user clicks the link:
  https://example.com/posts?page=4&original_script_name=javascript:alert(42)%3b//

  ### Releases
  The 1.2.1 gem including the patch has already been released.
  All past released versions are affected by this vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds
  Application developers who can't update the gem can workaround by overriding the `PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST` constant.

  ```ruby
  module Kaminari::Helpers
    PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST = [:authenticity_token, :commit, :utf8, :_method, :script_name, :original_script_name].freeze
  end
  ```
