title: Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers
date: 2022-04-26
description: |
  There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Action View tag helpers.  Passing
  untrusted input as hash keys can lead to a possible XSS vulnerability. This
  vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-27777.

  Versions Affected:  ALL
  Not affected:       NONE
  Fixed Versions:     7.0.2.4, 6.1.5.1, 6.0.4.8, 5.2.7.1

  ## Impact

  If untrusted data is passed as the hash key for tag attributes, there is a
  possibility that the untrusted data may not be properly escaped which can
  lead to an XSS vulnerability.

  Impacted code will look something like this:

  ```
  check_box_tag('thename', 'thevalue', false, aria: { malicious_input => 'thevalueofaria' })
  ```

  Where the "malicious_input" variable contains untrusted data.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  ## Releases

  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

  ## Workarounds

  Escape the untrusted data before using it as a key for tag helper methods.
