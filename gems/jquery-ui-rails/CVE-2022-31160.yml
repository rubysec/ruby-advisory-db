title:
  jQuery UI vulnerable to XSS when refreshing a checkboxradio with an HTML-like
  initial text label
date: 2022-07-15
description: |
  ### Impact
  Initializing a checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes
  that parent label contents considered as the input label. If you call
  `.checkboxradio( "refresh" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained
  encoded HTML entities, they will erroneously get decoded. This can lead to
  potentially executing JavaScript code.

  For example, starting with the following initial secure HTML:

  ```html
  <label>
  	<input id="test-input">
  	&lt;img src=x onerror="alert(1)"&gt;
  </label>
  ```

  and calling:

  ```javascript
  $( "#test-input" ).checkboxradio();
  $( "#test-input" ).checkboxradio( "refresh" );
  ```

  will turn the initial HTML into:

  ```html
  <label>
  	<!-- some jQuery UI elements -->
  	<input id="test-input">
  	<img src=x onerror="alert(1)">
  </label>
  ```

  and the alert will get executed.

  ### Patches
  The bug has been patched in jQuery UI 1.13.2.

  ### Workarounds
  To remediate the issue, if you can change the initial HTML, you can wrap all
  the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`:

  ```html
  <label>
  	<input id="test-input">
  	<span>&lt;img src=x onerror="alert(1)"&gt;</span>
  </label>
  ```
