title: CSRF Vulnerability with Non-Session Based Authentication
date: 2020-08-04
description: |
  The PgHero dashboard is vulnerable to CSRF with non-session based authentication methods.

  ## Impact
  The PgHero dashboard is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This affects the Docker
  image, Linux packages, and in specific cases, the Ruby gem. The Ruby gem is vulnerable with
  non-session based authentication methods like basic authentication - session-based authentication
  methods (like Devise's default authentication) are not affected.

  A CSRF attack works by getting an authorized user to visit a malicious website and then performing
  requests on behalf of the user. In this instance, actions include:

  1. Canceling running queries
  2. Running `EXPLAIN` on queries (without seeing the results, but can be used for denial of service
     and other attacks)
  3. Resetting query stats (running `pg_stat_statements_reset()`)
