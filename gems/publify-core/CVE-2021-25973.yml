title: Improper Authorization in Publify
date: 2021-11-03
description: |
  In Publify, 9.0.0.pre1 to 9.2.4 are vulnerable to Improper Access Control.
  `guest` role users can self-register even when the admin does not allow. This happens
  due to front-end restriction only.
cvss_v3: 6.5
unaffected_versions:
- "< 9.0.0.pre1"
patched_versions:
- ">= 9.2.5"
