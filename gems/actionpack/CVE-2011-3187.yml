title: Ruby on rails 3.0.5 Remote_IP.rb Input Validation in rails/actionpack
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  The to_s method in actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb
  in Ruby on Rails 3.0.5 does not validate the X-Forwarded-For header
  in requests from IP addresses on a Class C network, which might allow
  remote attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files or bypass
  intended address parsing via a crafted header.
