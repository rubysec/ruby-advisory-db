title: 'CVE-2013-1857 rubygem-actionpack: sanitize_protocol: XSS Vulnerability in
  the  helper of Ruby on Rails'
date: 2013-03-19
description: 'The sanitize helper in lib/action_controller/vendor/html-scanner/html/sanitizer.rb
  in the Action Pack component in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.18, 3.0.x and 3.1.x before
  3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.13 does not properly handle encoded : (colon) characters
  in URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks via a crafted scheme name, as demonstrated by including a &#x3a; sequence.
  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Action Pack. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to conduct XSS attacks against users of an application using Action
  Pack.'
