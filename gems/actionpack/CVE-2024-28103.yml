title: Missing security headers in Action Pack on non-HTML responses
date: 2024-06-04
description: |
  Permissions-Policy is Only Served on HTML Content-Type

  The application configurable Permissions-Policy is only served
  on responses with an HTML related Content-Type.

  This has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-28103.

  Versions Affected:  >= 6.1.0
  Not affected:       < 6.1.0
  Fixed Versions:     6.1.7.8, 7.0.8.4, and 7.1.3.4

  Impact

  Permissions-Policy. There are certain non-HTML Content-Types that
  would benefit from having the Permissions-Policy enforced.
