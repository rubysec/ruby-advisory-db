title: Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Ruby on Rails
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails
  before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not
  properly consider differences in parameter handling between the
  Active Record component and the Rack interface, which allows remote
  attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform
  NULL checks via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain
  "[nil]" values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2694.
