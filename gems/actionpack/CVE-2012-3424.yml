title: 'CVE-2012-3424 rubygem-actionpack: DoS vulnerability in authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest'
date: 2012-07-26
description: The decode_credentials method in actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb
  in Ruby on Rails 3.x before 3.0.16, 3.1.x before 3.1.7, and 3.2.x before 3.2.7 converts
  Digest Authentication strings to symbols, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service by leveraging access to an application that uses a with_http_digest
  helper method, as demonstrated by the authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest method.
