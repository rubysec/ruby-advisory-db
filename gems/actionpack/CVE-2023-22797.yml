title: Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack
date: 2023-01-18
description: |
  There is a vulnerability in Action Controller’s redirect_to. This
  vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22797.

  Versions Affected: >= 7.0.0
  Not affected: < 7.0.0
  Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.1

  # Impact

  There is a possible open redirect when using the redirect_to helper with
  untrusted user input.

  Vulnerable code will look like this:
  ```
  redirect_to(params[:some_param])
  ```

  Rails 7.0 introduced protection against open redirects from calling
  redirect_to with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer was
  fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check
  introduced could be bypassed by a carefully crafted URL.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
  the workarounds immediately.

  # Workarounds
