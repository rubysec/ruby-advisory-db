date: 2021-05-05
description: |
  There is a possible DoS vulnerability in the Token Authentication logic in
  Action Controller.  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2021-22904.

  Versions Affected:  >= 4.0.0
  Not affected:       < 4.0.0
  Fixed Versions:     6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, 5.2.6

  Impact
  ------
  Impacted code uses `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or
  `authenticate_with_http_token` for request authentication.  Impacted code will
  look something like this:

  ```
  class PostsController < ApplicationController
    before_action :authenticate

    private

    def authenticate
      authenticate_or_request_with_http_token do |token, options|
        # ...
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  Workarounds
  -----------

  the issue:

  ```ruby
  module ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Token
    AUTHN_PAIR_DELIMITERS = /(?:,|;|\t)/
  end
  ```
