date: 2023-01-18
description: |

  Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2023-22792.

  Versions Affected: >= 3.0.0

  # Impact

  Specially crafted cookies, in combination with a specially crafted
  X_FORWARDED_HOST header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a
  state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large
  amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users
  running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  # Workarounds

  We recommend that all users upgrade to one of the FIXED versions. In the
  meantime, users can mitigate this vulnerability by using a load balancer or
  other device to filter out malicious X_FORWARDED_HOST headers before they
  reach the application.
