title: Possible ReDoS vulnerability in query parameter filtering in Action Dispatch
date: 2024-10-15
description: |
  There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter
  filtering routines of Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has
  been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-41128.

  ## Impact

  Carefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter
  filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting
  in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release
  should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.

  Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications
  using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends
  on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.

  ## Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  ## Workarounds

  Users on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.
