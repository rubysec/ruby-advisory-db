title: 'CVE-2013-1855 rubygem-actionpack: css_sanitization: XSS vulnerability in sanitize_css'

  3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.13 does not properly handle \n (newline) characters,
  which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks via crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences. A cross-site scripting
  (XSS) flaw was found in Action Pack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
  XSS attacks against users of an application using Action Pack.
