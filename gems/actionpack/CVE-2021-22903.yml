title: Possible Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack
date: 2021-05-05
description: |
  There is a possible Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack. This
  vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2021-22903.

  Versions Affected:  >= v6.1.0.rc2
  Not affected:       < v6.1.0.rc2
  Fixed Versions:     6.1.3.2

  Impact
  ------
  This is similar to CVE-2021-22881: Specially crafted Host headers in
  combination with certain "allowed host" formats can cause the Host
  Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious
  website.

  Since rails/rails@9bc7ea5, strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading
  dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes,
  for example, config.hosts << "sub.example.com" to permit a request with a Host
  header value of sub-example.com.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  The following monkey patch put in an initializer can be used as a workaround:

  ```ruby
  class ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization::Permissions
    def sanitize_string(host)
      if host.start_with?(".")
        /\A(.+\.)?#{Regexp.escape(host[1..-1])}\z/i
      else
        /\A#{Regexp.escape host}\z/i
      end
    end
  end
  ```
