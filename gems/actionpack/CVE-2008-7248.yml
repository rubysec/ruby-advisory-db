title: Improper Input Validation in rails
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  Ruby on Rails 2.1 before 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.2 does not verify
  tokens for requests with certain content types, which allows remote
  attackers to bypass cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
  for requests to applications that rely on this protection, as
  demonstrated using text/plain.
