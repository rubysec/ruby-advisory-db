title: Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in i18n translations helper method
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the 'translate' helper
  method of the Ruby on Rails performed HTML escaping of interpolated user
  input, when interpolation in combination with HTML-safe translations were
  used. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web
  script by providing a specially-crafted input to Ruby on Rails application,
  using the ActionPack module and its 'translate' helper method without explicit
  (application specific) sanitization of user provided input.

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the i18n translations helper
  method in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.11 and 3.1.x before 3.1.2,
  and the rails_xss plugin in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, allows remote
  attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related
  to a translations string whose name ends with an "html" substring.
