title: 'CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection'
date: 2013-02-12
description: The JSON gem before 1.5.5, 1.6.x before 1.6.8, and 1.7.x before 1.7.7
  for Ruby allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption)
  or bypass the mass assignment protection mechanism via a crafted JSON document that
  triggers the creation of arbitrary Ruby symbols or certain internal objects, as
  demonstrated by conducting a SQL injection attack against Ruby on Rails, aka "Unsafe
  Object Creation Vulnerability."
