title: json Gem for Ruby Data Handling Stack Buffer Overflow
date: 2007-05-21
description: |
  json Gem for Ruby contains an overflow condition that is triggered as
  user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling specially crafted
  data. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a stack-based buffer
  overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the
  execution of arbitrary code.
