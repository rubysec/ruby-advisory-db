title: json Gem for Ruby Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability (additional fix)
date: 2020-03-19
description: |
  There is an unsafe object creation vulnerability in the json gem bundled with
  Ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2020-10663.
  We strongly recommend upgrading the json gem.

  Details
  -------

  When parsing certain JSON documents, the json gem (including the one bundled
  with Ruby) can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in the target system.

  This is the same issue as CVE-2013-0269. The previous fix was incomplete, which
  addressed JSON.parse(user_input), but didn’t address some other styles of JSON
  parsing including JSON(user_input) and JSON.parse(user_input, nil).

  See CVE-2013-0269 in detail. Note that the issue was exploitable to cause a
  Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable Symbol objects, but
  this kind of attack is no longer valid because Symbol objects are now
  garbage-collectable. However, creating arbitrary objects may cause severe
  security consequences depending upon the application code.
