title: Bypass vulnerability in Active Storage
date: 2018-11-27
description: |
  There is a vulnerability in Active Storage. This vulnerability has been
  assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-16477.

  Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0
  Not affected:       < 5.2.0
  Fixed Versions:     5.2.1.1

  Impact
  ------
  Signed download URLs generated by `ActiveStorage` for Google Cloud Storage
  service and Disk service include `content-disposition` and `content-type`
  parameters that an attacker can modify. This can be used to upload specially
  crafted HTML files and have them served and executed inline. Combined with
  other techniques such as cookie bombing and specially crafted AppCache manifests,
  an attacker can gain access to private signed URLs within a specific storage path.

  Vulnerable apps are those using either GCS or the Disk service in production.
  Other storage services such as S3 or Azure aren't affected.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately. For those using GCS, it's also recommended to run the
  following to update existing blobs:

  ```
  ActiveStorage::Blob.find_each do |blob|
    blob.send :update_service_metadata
  end
  ```
