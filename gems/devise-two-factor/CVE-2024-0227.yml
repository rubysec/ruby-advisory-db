title: Devise-Two-Factor vulnerable to brute force attacks
date: 2024-01-12
description: |
  Devise-Two-Factor does not throttle or otherwise restrict login
  attempts at the server by default. When combined with the Time-based
  One Time Password algorithm's (TOTP) inherent entropy limitations,
  it's possible for an attacker to bypass the 2FA mechanism through
  brute-force attacks.

  ### Impact

  If a user's username and password have already been compromised an
  attacker would be able to try possible TOTP codes and see if they
  can hit a lucky collision to log in as that user. The user under
  attack would not necessarily know that their account has been
  compromised.

  ### Patches

  Devise-Two-Factor has not released any fixes for this vulnerability.
  This library is open-ended by design and cannot solve this for all
  applications natively. It's recommended that any application leveraging
  Devise-Two-Factor implement controls at the application level to
  mitigate this threat. A non-exhaustive list of possible mitigations
  can be found below.

  #### Mitigations

  1. Use the `lockable` strategy from Devise to lock a user after a
     certain number of failed login attempts. See
     https://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Lockable
     for more information.

  2. Configure a rate limit for your application, especially on the
     endpoints used to log in. One such library to accomplish this is
     [rack-attack](https://rubygems.org/gems/rack-attack).

  3. When displaying authentication errors hide whether validating a
     username/password combination failed or a two-factor code failed
     behind a more generic error message.
