title: Resque Scheduler Reflected XSS In Delayed Jobs View
date: 2023-12-18
description: |

  ### Impact

  Resque Scheduler version 1.27.4 and above are affected by a cross-site
  scripting vulnerability. A remote attacker can inject javascript code
  to the "{schedule_job}" or "args" parameter in
  /resque/delayed/jobs/{schedule_job}?args={args_id} to execute
   javascript at client side.

  ### Patches

  Fixed in v4.10.2

  ### Workarounds

  No known workarounds at this time. It is recommended to not click on
  3rd party or untrusted links to the resque-web interface until you
  have patched your application.
