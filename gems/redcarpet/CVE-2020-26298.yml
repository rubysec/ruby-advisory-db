title: Injection/XSS in Redcarpet
description: |
  Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing. In Redcarpet before
  version 3.5.1, there is an injection vulnerability which can enable a cross-site
  scripting attack. In affected versions no HTML escaping was being performed when
  processing quotes. This applies even when the `:escape_html` option was being used.
