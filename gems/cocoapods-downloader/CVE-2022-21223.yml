title: Command injection in cocoapods-downloader
date: 2022-04-02
description: |
  The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.2 are vulnerable to Command
  Injection via hg argument injection. When calling the download function (when using
  hg), the url (and/or revision, tag, branch) is passed to the hg clone command in
  a way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform
  a command injection.
