title: Command injection in cocoapods-downloader
date: 2022-04-02
description: |
  The package cocoapods-downloader before 1.6.0, from 1.6.2 and before
  1.6.3 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling
  the Pod::Downloader.preprocess_options function and using git, both the git and
  branch parameters are passed to the git ls-remote subcommand in a way that additional
  flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.
