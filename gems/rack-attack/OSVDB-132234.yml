title:
  rack-attack Gem for Ruby missing normalization before request path
  processing
date: 2015-12-18
description: |
  When using rack-attack with a rails app, developers expect the request
  path to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so
  a request path "/login/" becomes "/login" by the time you're in
  ActionController.

  Since Rack::Attack runs before ActionDispatch, the request path is not
  yet normalized. This can cause throttles and blacklists to not work as
  expected.

  E.g., a throttle:

  `throttle('logins', ...) {|req| req.path == "/login" }`

  would not match a request to '/login/', though Rails would route
  '/login/' to the same '/login' action.
