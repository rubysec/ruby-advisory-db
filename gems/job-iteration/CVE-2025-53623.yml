title: Job Iteration API is vulnerable to OS Command Injection attack
  through its CsvEnumerator class
date: 2025-07-14
description: |
  ### Impact

  There is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the
  `CsvEnumerator` class of the `job-iteration` repository. This
  vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands on the system where the application is running, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or complete system
  compromise.

  ### Patches

  Issue is fixed in versions `1.11.0` and above.

  ### Workarounds

  Users can mitigate the risk by avoiding the use of untrusted input
  in the `CsvEnumerator` class and ensuring that any file paths are
  properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the class
  methods. Users should avoid calling `size` on enumerators
  constructed with untrusted CSV filenames.
