title: Trix has a stored XSS vulnerability through its attachment attribute
date: 2025-12-31
description: |
  ### Impact

  The Trix editor, in versions prior to 2.1.16, is vulnerable to
  XSS attacks through attachment payloads.

  An attacker could inject malicious code into a data-trix-attachment
  attribute that, when rendered as HTML and clicked on, could execute
  arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session,
  potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or
  sensitive information being disclosed.

  ### Patches

  Update Recommendation: Users should upgrade to Trix editor
  version 2.1.16 or later.
