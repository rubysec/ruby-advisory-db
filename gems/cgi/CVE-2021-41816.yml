title: Buffer Overrun in CGI.escape_html
date: 2021-11-24
description: |
  A security vulnerability that causes buffer overflow when you pass a very large
  string (> 700 MB) to `CGI.escape_html` on a platform where `long` type takes 4 bytes,
  typically, Windows.

  Please update the cgi gem to version 0.3.1, 0.2.1, and 0.1.1 or later. You can use
  `gem update cgi` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "cgi",
  ">= 0.3.1"` to your `Gemfile`. Alternatively, please update Ruby to 2.7.5 or 3.0.3.

  This issue has been introduced since Ruby 2.7, so the cgi version bundled with Ruby
  2.6 is not vulnerable.
cvss_v3: 7.5
patched_versions:
  - "~> 0.1.0.1"
  - "~> 0.1.1"
  - "~> 0.2.1"
  - ">= 0.3.1"
