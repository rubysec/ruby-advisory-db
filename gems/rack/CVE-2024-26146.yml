date: 2024-02-21
description: |
  There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the header parsing
  routines in Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2024-26146.

  Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 2.0.9.4, 2.1.4.4, 2.2.8.1, 3.0.9.1

  # Impact

  Carefully crafted headers can cause header parsing in Rack to take longer than
  expected resulting in a possible denial of service issue. `Accept` and
  `Forwarded` headers are impacted.

  Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rack applications using
  Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected.
