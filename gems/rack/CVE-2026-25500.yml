title: Rack::Directory vulnerable to reflected XSS in directory listings
date: 2026-01-16
description: |
  ## Summary

  `Rack::Directory` is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)
  in generated directory listings.

  ## Details

  User-controlled path content can be reflected in HTML output without
  sufficient escaping in `Rack::Directory`. Visiting a crafted URL can
  execute attacker-controlled JavaScript in a victim's browser.

  Affected versions:

  - `< 2.2.22`
  - `>= 3.0.0.beta1, < 3.1.20`
  - `>= 3.2.0.beta1, < 3.2.5`

  ## Impact

  Successful exploitation can run arbitrary JavaScript in the origin of
  the affected application, enabling session theft, content injection,
  or phishing-style attacks against users.

  ## Mitigation

  - Upgrade to a patched version of Rack.
  - Avoid exposing `Rack::Directory` listings to untrusted users.
patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.2.22"
  - ">= 3.1.20"
  - ">= 3.2.5"
