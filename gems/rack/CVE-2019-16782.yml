title: Possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability
description: |-
  There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack.

  Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks
  targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a
  database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that
  session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up
  a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack
  the session.

  The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is
  indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.

  Impact:

  The session id stored in a cookie is the same id that is used when querying
  the backing session storage engine.  Most storage mechanisms (for example a
  database) use some sort of indexing in order to speed up the lookup of that
  id.  By carefully timing requests and session lookup failures, an attacker
  may be able to perform a timing attack to determine an existing session id
  and hijack that session.
