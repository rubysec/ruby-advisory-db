title: Possible Log Injection in Rack::CommonLogger
date: 2025-02-12
description: |
  ## Summary

  `Rack::CommonLogger` can be exploited by crafting input that includes
  newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied
  proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs.

  ## Details

  When a user provides the authorization credentials via
  `Rack::Auth::Basic`, if success, the username will be put in
  `env['REMOTE_USER']` and later be used by `Rack::CommonLogger`
  for logging purposes.

  The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally
  allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white
  space characters, or the server just want to log every login
  attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character,
  the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters
  into the logfile.

  ## Impact

  Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries,
  potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data
  into log files.

  ## Mitigation

  - Update to the latest version of Rack.
