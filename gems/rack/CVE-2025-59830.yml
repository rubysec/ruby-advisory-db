title: Rack has an unsafe default in Rack::QueryParser allows
  params_limit bypass via semicolon-separated parameters
date: 2025-09-25
description: |
  ## Summary

  `Rack::QueryParser` in version `< 2.2.18` enforces its `params_limit`
  only for parameters separated by `&`, while still splitting on both
  `&` and `;`. As a result, attackers could use `;` separators to
  bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended.

  ## Details

  The issue arises because `Rack::QueryParser#check_query_string`
  counts only `&` characters when determining the number of parameters,
  but the default separator regex `DEFAULT_SEP = /[&;] */n` splits on
  both `&` and `;`. This mismatch means that queries using `;`
  separators were not included in the parameter count, allowing
  `params_limit` to be bypassed.

  Other safeguards (`bytesize_limit` and `key_space_limit`) still
  applied, but did not prevent this particular bypass.

  ## Impact

  Applications or middleware that directly invoke `Rack::QueryParser`
  with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be
  exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused
  as a limited denial-of-service vector.

  `Rack::Request`, the primary entry point for typical Rack applications,
  uses `QueryParser` in a safe way and does not appear vulnerable by
  default. As such, the severity is considered **low**, with the impact
  limited to edge cases where `QueryParser` is used directly.

  ## Mitigation

  * Upgrade to a patched version of Rack where both `&` and `;` are
    counted consistently toward `params_limit`.
  * If upgrading is not immediately possible, configure `QueryParser`
    with an explicit delimiter (e.g., `&`) to avoid the mismatch.
  * As a general precaution, enforce query string and request size
    limits at the web server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or
    a CDN) to mitigate excessive parsing overhead.
