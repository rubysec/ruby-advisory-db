title: Publify Vulnerable To Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Via
  Redirects Requiring User Interaction
date: 2025-03-28
description: |
  ### Summary

  A publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site
  scripting attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality.

  ### Details

  A publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site
  scripting attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality.
  The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator
  to click a malicious link.

  We can create a redirect to a `javascript:alert()` URL. Whilst the
  redirect itself doesn't work, on the administrative panel, an a tag
  is created with the payload as the URI. Upon clicking this link,
  the XSS is triggered.

  An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or
  other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator
  that this is a malicious link.

  ### Impact

  A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their
  privileges and become an administrator."
