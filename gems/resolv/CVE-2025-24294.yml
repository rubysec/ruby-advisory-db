title: Possible Denial of Service in resolv gem
date: 2025-07-09
description: |
  A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the
  resolv gem bundled with Ruby.
  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2025-24294. We recommend upgrading the resolv gem.

  ## Details
  The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the
  length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.

  An attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly
  compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a
  packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount
  of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting
  length of the name.

  This resource consumption can cause the application thread to
  become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

  ## Affected Version
  The vulnerability affects the resolv gem bundled with the
  following Ruby series:
  * Ruby 3.2 series: resolv version 0.2.2 and earlier
  * Ruby 3.3 series: resolv version 0.3.0
  * Ruby 3.4 series: resolv version 0.6.1 and earlier

  ## Credits
  Thanks to Manu for discovering this issue.
