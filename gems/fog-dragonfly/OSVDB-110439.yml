title: Dragonfly Gem for Ruby Image Uploading & Processing Remote Command Execution
date: 2010-04-27
description: |
  Dragonfly Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in Uploading & Processing
  that is due to the gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to
  imagemagicks convert. This may allow a remote attacker to gain
  read/write access to the filesystem and execute arbitrary commands.

  This gem has been renamed. Please use "dragonfly" from now on.
