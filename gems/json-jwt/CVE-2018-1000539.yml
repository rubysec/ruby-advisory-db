title: Auth tag forgery vulnerability with AES-GCM encrypted JWT
date: 2018-04-30
description: |
  Ruby's OpenSSL bindings do not check the length of the supplied
  authentication tag when decrypting an authenticated encryption mode
  such as AES-GCM, leaving this up to the authors of a gem/app to
  implement for properly validating the message.

  json-jwt was not checking for the authentication tag length, meaning
  that with a one byte tag the JWT would be considered not tampered
  with. This means that with an average of 128 (max 256) attempts an
  attacker can forge a valid signature.
