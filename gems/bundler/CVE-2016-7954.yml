title: Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into your application
  via any secondary Gem source declared in your Gemfile
date: 2016-10-06
description: |
  Bundler 1.x might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary Ruby
  code into an application by leveraging a Gem name collision on a
  secondary source.

  Please note that this vulnerability only applies for Ruby
  projects using Bundler < 2.0 with Gemfiles having 2 or more
  "source" lines.

  In other words, if the user's Gemfile does not use multiple
  sources, this vulnerability can be ignored.
