title: Bundler Gem for Ruby Missing SSL Certificate Validation MitM Spoofing
date: 2013-02-12
description: |
  Bundler Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as SSL certificates are not properly
  validated. By spoofing the SSL server via a certificate that appears valid,
  an attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS
  cache poisoning) can disclose and optionally manipulate transmitted data.
