  ### Impact
  If an attacker can infer the slug or URL of an unpublished or private
  resource, and this resource can be embedded (such as a Participatory
  Process, an Assembly, a Proposal, a Result, etc), then some data of
  this resource could be accessed.

  Version 0.27.6

  https://github.com/decidim/decidim/commit/1756fa639ef393ca8e8bb16221cab2e2e7875705
