title: Decidim::Admin vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) in
  the admin panel with QuillJS WYSWYG editor
date: 2024-09-16
description: |
  ### Impact
  The WYSWYG editor QuillJS is subject to potential XSS attach in
  case the attacker manages to modify the HTML before being
  uploaded to the server.

  The attacker is able to change e.g. to <svg onload=alert('XSS')>
  if they know how to craft these requests themselves.

  ### Patches
  N/A

  ### Workarounds
  Review the user accounts that have access to the admin panel (i.e.
  general Administrators, and participatory space's Administrators)
  and remove access to them if they don't need it.

  Disable the "Enable rich text editor for participants" setting in
  the admin dashboard.
