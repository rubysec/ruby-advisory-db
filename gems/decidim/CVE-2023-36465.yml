title: Decidim has broken access control in templates
date: 2023-10-05
description: |
  ### Impact

  The `templates` module doesn't enforce the correct permissions,
  allowing any logged-in user to access to this functionality in
  the administration panel. An attacker could use this vulnerability
  to change, create or delete templates of surveys.
