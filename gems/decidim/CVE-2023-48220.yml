title: Possibility to circumvent the invitation token expiry period
date: 2024-02-20
description: |
  ### Impact
  The invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality.

  When using the password reset functionality, the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited as shown in this piece of code within the `devise_invitable` gem:
  https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable/blob/41f58970ff76fb64382a9b9ea1bd530f7c3adab2/lib/devise_invitable/models.rb#L198

  The only check done here is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period as explained in the gem's documentation:
  https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable#model-configuration-

  > `invite_for`: The period the generated invitation token is valid. After this period, the invited resource won’t be able to accept the invitation. When `invite_for` is `0` (the default), the invitation won’t expire.

  Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected:
  https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/d2d390578050772d1bdb6d731395f1afc39dcbfc/decidim-core/config/initializers/devise.rb#L134

  The bug is in the `devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available.

  ### Patches
  Update `devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` or above by running the following command:

  ```
  $ bundle update devise_invitable
  ```

  ### Workarounds
  The invitations can be cancelled directly from the database by running the following command from the Rails console:

  ```
  > Decidim::User.invitation_not_accepted.update_all(invitation_token: nil)
  ```
