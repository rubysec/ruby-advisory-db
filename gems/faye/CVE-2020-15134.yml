title: Missing TLS certificate verification
description: |-
  Faye uses [em-http-request][6] and [faye-websocket][10] in the Ruby version of
  its client. Those libraries both use the [`EM::Connection#start_tls`][1] method
  in [EventMachine][2] to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is
  used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification
  by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and
  trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `https:`
  or `wss:` connection made using these libraries is vulnerable to a
  man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server
  it is connected to.

  The first request a Faye client makes is always sent via normal HTTP, but later
  messages may be sent via WebSocket. Therefore it is vulnerable to the same
  problem that these underlying libraries are, and we needed both libraries to
  support TLS verification before Faye could claim to do the same. Your client
  would still be insecure if its initial HTTPS request was verified, but later
  WebSocket connections were not.

  This has been a requested feature in EventMachine for many years now; see for
  example [#275][3], [#378][4], and [#814][5]. In June 2020, em-http-request
  published an [advisory][7] related to this problem and fixed it by [implementing
  TLS verification][8] in their own codebase; although EventMachine does not
  implement certificate verification itself, it provides an extension point for
  the caller to implement it, called [`ssl_verify_peer`][9]. Based on this
  implementation, we have incorporated similar functionality into faye-websocket.

  After implementing verification in v1.1.6, em-http-request has elected to leave
  the `:verify_peer` option switched off by default. We have decided to _enable_
  this option by default in Faye, but are publishing a minor release with added
  functionality for configuring it. We are mindful of the fact that this may break
  existing programs, but we consider it much more important that all clients have
  TLS verification turned on by default. A client that is not carrying out
  verification is either:

  - talking to the expected server, and will not break under this change
  - being attacked, and would benefit from being alerted to this fact
  - deliberately talking to a server that would be rejected by verification

  The latter case includes situations like talking to a non-public server using a
  self-signed certificate. We consider this use case to be "working by accident",
  rather than functionality that was actively supported, and it should be properly
  and explicitly supported instead.

  We are releasing Faye v1.4.0, which enables verification by default and provides
  a way to opt out of it:

  ```rb
  client = Faye::Client.new('https://example.com/', tls: { verify_peer: false })
  ```

  Unfortunately we can't offer an equivalent of the `:root_cert_file` option that
  has been added to faye-websocket, because em-http-request does not support it.
  If you need to talk to servers whose certificates are not recognised by your
  default root certificates, then you need to add its certificate (or another one
  that can verify it) to your system's root set.

  The same functionality is now supported in the Node.js version, with a `tls`
  option whose values will be passed to the `https` and `tls` modules as
  appropriate when making connections. For example, you can provide your own CA
  certificate:

  ```js
  var client = new faye.Client('https://example.com/', {
    tls: {
      ca: fs.readFileSync('path/to/certificate.pem')
    }
  });
  ```

  Morsing][15] for providing invaluable assistance and feedback on this issue.
