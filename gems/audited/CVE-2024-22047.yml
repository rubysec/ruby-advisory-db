title: Race Condition leading to logging errors
date: 2023-05-01
description: |
  In certain setups with threaded web servers, Audited's use of
  `Thread.current` can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user.

  Fixed in 5.3.3.

  In March, @convisoappsec noticed that the library in question had a
  Race Condition problem, which caused logs to be registered at times
  with different users than those who performed the genuine actions.

  - The first issue we identified was from November
    2021: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601

  - So the solution was implemented in the following Pull Request:
    https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669

  - And the feature was published in version 5.3.3:
    RELEASE: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671
cvss_v3: 3.1
unaffected_versions:
  - "< 4.0.0"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 5.3.3"
