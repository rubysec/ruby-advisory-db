title: Prototype Pollution in lodash
date: 2018-07-26
description: |
  Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.5 are vulnerable to
  prototype pollution.

  The vulnerable functions are 'defaultsDeep', 'merge', and
  'mergeWith' which allow a malicious user to modify the
  prototype of `Object` via `__proto__` causing the addition
  or modification of an existing property that will exist
  on all objects.

  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 4.17.5 or later."
cvss_v2: 4.0
cvss_v3: 6.5
