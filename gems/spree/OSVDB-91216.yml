title: Spree Gem Contains Arbitrary Ruby Object Instantiation Command Execution in Admin View
date: 2013-02-21
description: >  
  Spree contains several instances of passing user controlled
  parameters to String#constantize. This may allow an attacker to
  instantiate arbitrary Ruby objects and potentially execute arbitrary
  commands. This flaw exists in the admin-accessible controllers.
