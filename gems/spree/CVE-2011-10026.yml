title: Spree Commerce is vulnerable to RCE through Search API
date: 2025-08-20
description: |
  Spreecommerce versions prior to 0.50.x contain a remote command
  execution vulnerability in the API's search functionality. Improper
  input sanitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands
  via the search[instance_eval] parameter, which is dynamically invoked
  using Ruby’s send method. This flaw enables unauthenticated attackers
  to execute commands on the server.
