title: Remote Command Execution in Spree search functionality
date: 2011-02-10
description: |
  Spree versions prior to 0.60.2 contain a remote command execution
  vulnerability in the search functionality. The application fails to
  properly sanitize input passed via the `search[:send][]` parameter,
  which is dynamically invoked using Ruby’s `send` method. This allows
  attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server without
  authentication.
