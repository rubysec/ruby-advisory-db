title: Spree Ruby Gem contains a flaw in the API
date: 2015-03-05
description: |
  Spree contains a flaw in the API as HTTP requests do not require
  multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when
  performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into
  following a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker
  can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack
  causing the victim to disclose potentially sensitive information
  to attackers.
