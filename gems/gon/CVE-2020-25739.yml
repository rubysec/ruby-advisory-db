title: Gon gem lack of escaping certain input when outputting as JSON

description: |
  An issue was discovered in the gon gem before gon-6.4.0 for Ruby. MultiJson
  does not honor the escape_mode parameter to escape fields as an XSS
  protection mechanism. To mitigate, json_dumper.rb in gon now does escaping
  for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson.

patched_versions:
  - ">= 6.4.0"
