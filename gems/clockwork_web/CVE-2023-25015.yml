title: CSRF Vulnerability with Rails < 5.2
date: 2023-02-01
description: |
  Clockwork Web is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) with Rails < 5.2.

  A CSRF attack works by getting an authorized user to visit a malicious website and
  then performing requests on behalf of the user. In this instance, actions include
  enabling and disabling jobs.
