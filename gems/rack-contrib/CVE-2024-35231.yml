title: Denial of Service in rack-contrib via "profiler_runs" parameter
date: 2024-05-27
description: |
  rack-contrib prior to version 2.5.0 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service
  via the `profiler_runs` HTTP request parameter.

  Versions Affected: < 2.5.0
  Fixed Versions: >= 2.5.0

  # Impact

  An attacker can trigger a Denial of Service by sending an HTTP request with
  an overly large `profiler_runs` parameter.

  ```shell
  curl  "http://127.0.0.1:9292/?profiler_runs=9999999999&profile=process_time"
  ```

  # Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  # Workarounds

  There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
