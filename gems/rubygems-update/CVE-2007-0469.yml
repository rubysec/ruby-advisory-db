title: 'CVE-2007-0469 RubyGems: Specially-crafted Gem archive can overwrite system
  files'
date: 2007-01-22
description: The extract_files function in installer.rb in RubyGems before 0.9.1 does
  not check whether files exist before overwriting them, which allows user-assisted
  remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or execute
  arbitrary code via crafted GEM packages.
