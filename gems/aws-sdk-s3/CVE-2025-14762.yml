title: AWS SDK for Ruby's S3 Encryption Client has a Key Commitment Issue
date: 2025-12-18
description: |
  ## Summary

  S3 Encryption Client for Ruby is an open-source client-side encryption
  library used to facilitate writing and reading encrypted records to S3.

  When the encrypted data key (EDK) is stored in an "Instruction File"
  instead of S3's metadata record, the EDK is exposed to an "Invisible
  Salamanders" attack (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016), which could
  allow the EDK to be replaced with a new key.

  ## Impact

  ### Background - Key Commitment

  There is a cryptographic property whereby under certain conditions,
  a single ciphertext can be decrypted into 2 different plaintexts by
  using different encryption keys. To address this issue, strong
  encryption schemes use what is known as "key commitment", a process
  by which an encrypted message can only be decrypted by one key;
  the key used to originally encrypt the message.

  In older versions of S3EC, when customers are also using a feature
  called "Instruction File" to store EDKs, key commitment is not
  implemented because multiple EDKs could be associated to an underlying
  encrypted message object.  For such customers an attack that leverages
  the lack of key commitment is possible.  A bad actor would need two
  things to leverage this issue:
    (i) the ability to create a separate, rogue, EDK that will also
         decrypt the underlying object to produce desired plaintext, and
    (ii) permission to upload a new instruction file to the S3 bucket
         to replace the existing instruction file placed there by the
         user using the S3C.  Any future attempt to decrypt the
         underlying encrypted message with the S3EC will unwittingly
         use the rogue EDK to produce a valid plaintext message.

  ### Impacted versions: <= 1.207.0

  ## Patches

  We are introducing the concept of "key commitment\" to S3EC where the
  EDK is cryptographically bound to the ciphertext in order to address
  this issue.  In order to maintain compatibility for in-flight messages
  we are releasing the fix in two versions. A code-compatible minor
  version that can read messages with key-commitment but not write them,
  and a new major version that can both read and write messages with
  key-commitment. For maximum safety customers are asked to upgrade to
  the latest major version: 1.208.0 or later.

  ### Workarounds

  There are no workarounds, please upgrade to the suggested version of S3EC.
