title: Integer overflow in cmark-gfm table parsing extension leads to heap memory
  corruption
date: 2022-03-03
description: |

  ### Impact

  CommonMarker uses `cmark-gfm` for rendering
  [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
  An [integer overflow in `cmark-gfm`'s table row parsing](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x)
  may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker
  rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap
  corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution.

  If affected versions of CommonMarker are used for rendering remote
  user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to
  Remote Code Execution (RCE).

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability has been patched in the following CommonMarker release:

  - v0.23.4

  ### Workarounds

  The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of
  `cmark-gfm`. Disabling any use of the table extension will prevent
  this vulnerability from being triggered.
