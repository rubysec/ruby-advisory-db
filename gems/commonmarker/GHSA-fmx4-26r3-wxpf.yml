title: Integer overflow in cmark-gfm table parsing extension leads to heap memory corruption
date: 2022-03-03
description: |
  ### Impact

  CommonMarker uses `cmark-gfm` for rendering [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
  An [integer overflow in `cmark-gfm`'s table row parsing](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x)
  may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX
  columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution.

  If affected versions of CommonMarker are used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this
  vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability has been patched in the following CommonMarker release:

  - v0.23.4

  ### Workarounds

  The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of `cmark-gfm`. Disabling any use of the
  table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.
