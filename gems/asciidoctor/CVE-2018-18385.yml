title: Asciidoctor Infinite Loop vulnerability
date: 2022-05-13
description: |
  Asciidoctor in versions < 1.5.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (infinite loop). The loop was caused by the fact that `Parser.next_block`
  was not exhausting all the lines in the reader as the while loop expected it would.
  This was happening because the regular expression that detects any list was not
  agreeing with the regular expression that detects a specific list type. So the line
  kept getting pushed back onto the reader, hence causing the loop.
cvss_v3: 7.5
patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.5.8"
