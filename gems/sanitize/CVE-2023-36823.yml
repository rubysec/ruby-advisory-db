title: Sanitize vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting via insufficient
  neutralization  of `style` element content
date: 2023-07-06
description: |
  ### Impact

  Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak
  arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize `>= 3.0.0, < 6.0.2` when
  Sanitize is configured to use the built-in "relaxed" config or
  when using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one
  or more CSS at-rules. This could result in XSS (cross-site scripting)
  or other undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are
  rendered in a browser.

  ### Patches

  Sanitize `>= 6.0.2` performs additional escaping of CSS in `style`
  element content, which fixes this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using a
  Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style` elements, using a Sanitize
  config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules, or by manually escaping the
  character sequence `</` as `<\/` in `style` element content.

  ### Credit

  This issue was found by @cure53 during an audit of a project that
  uses Sanitize and was reported by one of that project's maintainers.
  Thank you!
