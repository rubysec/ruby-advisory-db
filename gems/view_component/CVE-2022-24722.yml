title: XSS via `translate` method of `ViewComponent::Translatable` in view_component gem
date: 2022-03-02
description: |
  This is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using
  translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and
  passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly
  sanitized before display.

  Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability.

  Avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs
  before passing them.
