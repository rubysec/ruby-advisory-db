title: Regular Expression Denial of Service in Addressable templates
description: |
  Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption,
  leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input,
  but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this.
  Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected.
