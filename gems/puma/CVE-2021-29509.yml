title: Keepalive Connections Causing Denial Of Service in puma
description: |-
  ### Impact

  The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected
  existing connections that had already been accepted from having their
  requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in
  the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy
  persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the
  cluster.

  A puma server which received more concurrent keep-alive connections than the
  server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of
  connections, denying service to the unserved connections.

  ### Patches

  This problem has been fixed in puma 4.3.8 and 5.3.1.

  ### Workarounds

  Setting queue_requests false also fixes the issue. This is not advised when
  using puma without a reverse proxy, such as nginx or apache, because you will
  open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. [slowloris][1]).

  The fix is very small. [A git patch is available here][2] for those using
  [unsupported versions][3] of Puma.
