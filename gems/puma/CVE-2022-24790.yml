title: HTTP Request Smuggling in puma
date: 2022-03-30
description: |
  ### Impact

  When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the
  incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend
  proxy may disagree on where a request starts and ends. This would allow
  requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to Puma.

  The following vulnerabilities are addressed by this advisory:
  - Lenient parsing of `Transfer-Encoding` headers, when unsupported encodings
    should be rejected and the final encoding must be `chunked`.
  - Lenient parsing of malformed `Content-Length` headers and chunk sizes, when
    only digits and hex digits should be allowed.
  - Lenient parsing of duplicate `Content-Length` headers, when they should be
    rejected.
  - Lenient parsing of the ending of chunked segments, when they should end
    with `\r\n`.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12.

  ### Workarounds

  When deploying a proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality
  to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard.

  These proxy servers are known to have "good" behavior re: this standard and
  upgrading Puma may not be necessary. Users are encouraged to validate for
  themselves.

  - Nginx (latest)
  - Apache (latest)
  - Haproxy 2.5+
  - Caddy (latest)
  - Traefik (latest)
