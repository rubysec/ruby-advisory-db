title: Improper Certificate Validation in oauth ruby gem
description: |
  lib/oauth/consumer.rb in the oauth-ruby gem through 0.5.4 for Ruby does
  not verify server X.509 certificates if a certificate bundle cannot be found, which
  allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information.
