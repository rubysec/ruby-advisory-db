title: graphql allows remote code execution when loading a crafted GraphQL schema
date: 2025-03-12
description: |
  Loading a malicious schema definition in
  `GraphQL::Schema.from_introspection` (or `GraphQL::Schema::Loader.load`)
  can result in remote code execution. Any system which loads a schema
  by JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable, including those that
  use [GraphQL::Client](https://github.com/github-community-projects/graphql-client)
  to load external schemas via GraphQL introspection.
