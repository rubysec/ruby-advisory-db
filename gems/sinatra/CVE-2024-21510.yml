title: Sinatra vulnerable to Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
date: 2024-11-01
description: |
  Versions of the package sinatra from 0.0.0 are vulnerable to
  Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision via the
  X-Forwarded-Host (XFH) header.

  When making a request to a method with redirect applied, it is
  possible to trigger an Open Redirect Attack by inserting an
  arbitrary address into this header. If used for caching purposes,
  such as with servers like Nginx, or as a reverse proxy, without
  handling the X-Forwarded-Host header, attackers can potentially
  exploit Cache Poisoning or Routing-based SSRF.
