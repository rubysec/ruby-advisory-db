title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in trestle-auth
description: |
  ### Impact

  A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows
  an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in
  CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth
  admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter
  protected data, including admin account credentials.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been fixed in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems.
cvss_v3: 8.1
patched_versions:
- '>= 0.4.2'

unaffected_versions:
- < 0.4.0
