title: Server side request forgery in gibbon
date: 2022-04-26
description: |
  Gibbon v3.4.4 and below allows attackers to execute a Server-Side Request
  Forgery (SSRF) via a crafted URL. A partial fix has been introduced in version 3.4.4,
  however a complete fix has not yet been created. See Pull request 321 in github.com/amro/gibbon
  for details.
