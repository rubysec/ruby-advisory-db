title: Arabic Prawn Gem for Ruby lib/string_utf_support.rb
  User Input Handling Remote Command Injection
date: 2014-03-10
description: |
  Arabic Prawn Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the lib/string_utf_support.rb
  file. The issue is due to the program failing to sanitize user input. This may
  allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

  "lib/string_utf_support.rb" in the Arabic Prawn 0.0.1 gem for Ruby
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell
  metacharacters  in the (1) downloaded_file or (2) url variable.
cvss_v2: 7.5
