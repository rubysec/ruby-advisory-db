title: request_store has Incorrect Default Permissions
date: 2024-08-23
description: |
  ### Impact

  The files published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666
  permissions, meaning that they are world-writable, which allows
  local users to execute arbitrary code.

  This version was published in 2017, and most production environments
  do not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being
  exploited are very low, given that the vast majority of users will
  have upgraded, and those that have not, if any, are not likely to
  be exposed.

  ### Patches

  I am not aware of any other version of the gem with incorrect
  permissions, so simply upgrading should fix the issue.

  ### Workarounds

  You could chmod the files yourself, I guess.
