title: Octopoller gem published with world-writable files
date: 2022-06-15
description: |
  ### Impact

  Version [0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.2.0)
  of the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically,
  the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e.
  0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644).

  This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the
  instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable
  files from this gem.

  Malicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this
  package, could modify the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.

  ### Patches
  * octopoller v0.3.0

  ### Workarounds
  Users can use the previous version of the gem [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.1.0).
  Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able
  to upgrade to the latest version.
