title: HTTP Request Smuggling in goliath
description: |
  goliath through 1.0.6 allows request smuggling attacks where goliath
  is used as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable. It is possible
  to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice.
  Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid
  which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks.
