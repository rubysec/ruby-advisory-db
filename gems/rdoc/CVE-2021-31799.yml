title: RDoc OS command injection vulnerability
date: 2021-05-02
description: |
  RDoc used to call `Kernel#open` to open a local file. If a Ruby project has
  a file whose name starts with `|` and ends with `tags`, the command following
  the pipe character is executed. A malicious Ruby project could exploit it to
  run an arbitrary command execution against a user who attempts to run `rdoc`
  command.
