title: rswag vulnerable to arbitrary JSON and YAML file read via directory traversal
date: 2023-07-15
description: |
  rswag before 2.10.1 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary JSON and
  YAML files via directory traversal, because rswag-api can expose a file that is
  not the OpenAPI (or Swagger) specification file of a project.
