title: strong_password Ruby gem malicious version causing Remote Code Execution vulnerability
date: 2019-07-05
description: |
  The `strong_password` gem on RubyGems.org was hijacked by a malicious actor. The
  malicious actor published v0.0.7 containing malicious code that enables an attacker
  to execute remote code in production.

  Upgrade `strong_password` to v0.0.8 to ensure no malicious code execution is possible.
unaffected_versions:
- '!= 0.0.7'
patched_versions:
- '>= 0.0.8'
