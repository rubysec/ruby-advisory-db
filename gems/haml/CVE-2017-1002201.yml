title: haml failure to escape single quotes
date: 2017-05-08
description: |
  In haml versions prior to version 5.0.0.beta.2, when using user input to
  perform tasks on the server, characters like < > " ' must be escaped properly.
  In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can manipulate the input
  to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code.
