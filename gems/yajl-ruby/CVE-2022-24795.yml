title: Reallocation bug can trigger heap memory corruption
date: 2022-04-05
description: |
  The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl)
  contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption
  when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs.

  ### Details

  The [reallocation logic at yajl_buf.c#L64](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/blob/7168bd79b888900aa94523301126f968a93eb3a6/ext/yajl/yajl_buf.c#L64)
  may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches
  a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation
  of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk.

  These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which
  practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however
  this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which
  `size_t` is a 32bit integer.

  Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the
  original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption.

  ### Impact

  We rate this as a moderate severity vulnerability which mostly impacts
  process availability as we believe exploitation for arbitrary code
  execution to be unlikely.

  ### Patches

  Patched in yajl-ruby 1.4.2

  ### Workarounds

  Avoid passing large inputs to YAJL
