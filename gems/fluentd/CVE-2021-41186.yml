title: ReDoS vulnerability in parser_apache2
date: 2021-11-01
description: |
  ### Impact
  parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.

  ### Patches
  v1.14.2

  ### Workarounds
  Either of the following:

  * Don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs which cannot guarantee generated by Apache.
  * Put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin  directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).
