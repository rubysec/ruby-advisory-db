title: Denial of Service in jquery
date: 2018-01-18
description: |
  Affected versions of `jquery` use a lowercasing logic on attribute
  names. When given a boolean attribute with a name that contains
  uppercase characters, `jquery` enters into an infinite recursion
  loop, exceeding the call stack limit, and resulting in a denial
  of service condition.

  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 3.0.0 or later.
cvss_v2: 5.0
cvss_v3: 7.5
unaffected_versions:
  - "< 3.0.0-rc.1"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.0"
