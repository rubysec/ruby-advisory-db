title: Cross-Site Scripting in jquery
date: 2020-05-20
description: |
  Versions of `jquery` prior to 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Scripting. The load method fails to recognize and remove "<script>"
  HTML tags that contain a whitespace character, i.e: "</script >",
  which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed. This
  allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.
