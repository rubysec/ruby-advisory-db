title: Cross-Site Scripting in jquery
date: 2020-05-20
description: |
  Versions of `jquery` prior to 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The load method fails to recognize and remove "<script>" HTML tags that contain a whitespace character, i.e: "</script >", which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.9.0 or later.
cvss_v3: 6.1
patched_versions:
  - ">= 2.2.0"
