title: Denial of Service in uap-core when processing crafted User-Agent strings
description: |-
  ### Impact
  Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to
  overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by
  setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long
  strings.

  ### Patches
  Please update `uap-ruby` to &gt;= v2.6.0
