title: sidekiq-unique-jobs UI server vulnerable to XSS & RCE in Redis
date: 2024-02-13
description: |
  Cross site scripting (XSS) potentially exposing cookies / sessions / localStorage, fixed by sidekiq-unique-jobs v8.0.7.

  ### Details

  Specially crafted URL query parameters handled by any of the following endpoints of sidekiq-unique-jobs' "admin" web UI,
  allow a super-user attacker, or an unwitting, but authorized, victim, who has received a disguised / crafted link,
  to successfully execute malicious code, which could potentially steal cookies, session data,
  or local storage data from the app the sidekiq-unique-jobs web UI is mounted in.

  If your sidekiq-unique-jobs web UI is mounted at `/sidekiq`, the vulnerable paths and query parameters are:

  * `/sidekiq/changelogs`
    * `filter`
    * `count`
  * `/sidekiq/locks`
    * `filter`
    * `count`
  * `/sidekiq/expiring_locks`
    * `filter`

  ### Impact

  This is a vulnerability of critical severity, which impacts many thousands of sites, since sidekiq-unique-jobs is widely deployed across the industry, with multiple attack vectors.

  ### Patches

  The fix for the XSS vulnerability was released in sidekiq-unique-jobs v8.0.7.
