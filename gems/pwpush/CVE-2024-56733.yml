title: Password Pusher Allows Session Token Interception Leading
  to Potential Hijacking
date: 2024-12-30
description: |
  ### Impact

  A vulnerability has been reported in Password Pusher where an
  attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out,
  potentially allowing session hijacking.

  Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout,
  if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this
  process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the
  user's session until the token expires or is manually cleared.

  This vulnerability hinges on the attacker's ability to access the
  session cookie during an active session, either through a
  man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like
  XSS, or via direct access to the victim's device.

  ### Patches

  Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is
  recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to
  best mitigate risk.

  ### Workarounds

  If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over
  SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from
  being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement best practices
  in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data
  against unauthorized access.

  To further mitigate session hijacking risks, Password Pusher
  implements the following security measures:

  1. **Automatic Session Expiration**: Sessions are automatically
     expired after 2 hours of inactivity, reducing the window for
     potential exploitation.

  2. **Session Reset on Login and Logout**: Sessions are fully reset
     both when a user logs in and logs out, ensuring that session
     tokens are not reusable post-logout. This practice invalidates
     old session tokens and issues new ones, minimizing the risk of
     session hijacking.

  3. **Encrypted Cookies**: Cookies are encrypted using the value of
     SECRET_KEY_BASE from the application's configuration. This
     encryption adds a layer of protection against tampering or reading
     the session cookie's contents if intercepted, although it doesn't
     prevent the cookie from being used if stolen.

  **Note**: While these measures significantly enhance security, they
  are part of a broader security strategy.
