title: Unintended read access in kramdown gem
description: |
  The kramdown gem before 2.3.0 for Ruby processes the template option inside
  Kramdown documents by default, which allows unintended read access (such as
  template="/etc/passwd") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such as a
  string that begins with template="string://<%= `). NOTE: kramdown is used in
  Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum.
