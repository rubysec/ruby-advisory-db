title: SSRF vulnerability in Recurly gem's Resource#find.
date: 2017-11-09
description: |
  If you are using the #find method on any of the classes that are derived from
  the Resource class and you are passing user input into that method, a
  malicious user can force the http client to reach out to a server under their
  control. This can lead to leakage of your private API key.

  Because of the severity of impact, we are recommending that all users upgrade
  to a patched version. We have provided a non-breaking patch for every 2.X
  version of the client.
patched_versions:
- ~> 2.0.13
- ~> 2.1.11
- ~> 2.2.5
- ~> 2.3.10
- ~> 2.4.11
- ~> 2.5.3
- ~> 2.6.3
- ~> 2.7.8
- ~> 2.8.2
- ~> 2.9.2
- ~> 2.10.4
- ~> 2.11.3
- '>= 2.12.0'
