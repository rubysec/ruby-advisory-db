title: Katello uses hard coded credential
date: 2022-05-17
description: |
  The installation script in Katello 1.0 and earlier does not properly
  generate the `Application.config.secret_token` value, which causes
  each default installation to have the same secret token, and allows
  remote attackers to authenticate to the CloudForms System Engine
  web interface as an arbitrary user by creating a cookie using the
  default `secret_token`.
