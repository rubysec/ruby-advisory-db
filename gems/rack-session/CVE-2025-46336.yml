title: Rack session gets restored after deletion
date: 2025-05-08
description: |
  ## Summary

  When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack
  requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the
  unauthenticated user to occupy that session.

  ## Details

  [Rack session middleware](https://github.com/rack/rack-session/blob/v2.1.0/lib/rack/session/abstract/id.rb#L271-L278)
  prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back
  to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application.
  This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in
  general sense over concurrent rack requests.

  ## Impact

  When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the
  attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the
  session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running
  request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out,
  in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout.

  ## Mitigation

  - Update to the latest version of `rack-session`, or
  - Ensure your application invalidates sessions atomically by marking
    them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of
    deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse, or
  - Implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation
    timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was
    invalidated after the request began.
