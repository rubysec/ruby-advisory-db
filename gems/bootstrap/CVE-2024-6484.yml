date: 2024-07-11
description: |
  A vulnerability has been identified in Bootstrap that exposes users
  to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The issue is present in the
  carousel component, where the data-slide and data-slide-to attributes
  can be exploited through the href attribute of an <a> tag due to
  inadequate sanitization. This vulnerability could potentially enable
  attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's browser.
