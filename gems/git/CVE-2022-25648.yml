title: Command injection in ruby-git
date: 2022-04-20
description: |
  The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via
  git argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {}) function,
  the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a way that additional
  flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.
