title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through unescaped
  HTML attribute values
date: 2025-11-06
description: |
  ### Impact

  The prosemirror_to_html gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) attacks through malicious HTML attribute values. While tag
  content is properly escaped, attribute values are not, allowing
  attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

  **Who is impacted:**

  - Any application using prosemirror_to_html to convert ProseMirror
    documents to HTML
  - Applications that process user-generated ProseMirror content are
    at highest risk
  - End users viewing the rendered HTML output could have malicious
   JavaScript executed in their browsers

  **Attack vectors include:**

  - `href` attributes with `javascript:` protocol:
    `<a href="javascript:alert(document.cookie)">`
  - Event handlers: `<div onclick="maliciousCode()">`
  - `onerror` attributes on images: `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">`
  - Other HTML attributes that can execute JavaScript

  ### Patches

  A fix is currently in development. Users should upgrade to version
  **0.2.1** or later once released.

  The patch escapes all HTML attribute values using `CGI.escapeHTML`
  to prevent injection attacks.

  ### Workarounds

  Until a patched version is available, users can implement one or
  more of these mitigations:

  1. **Sanitize output**: Pass the HTML output through a sanitization
     library like [Sanitize](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize) or
     [Loofah](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah):

  ```ruby
     html = ProsemirrorToHtml.render(document)
     safe_html = Sanitize.fragment(html, Sanitize::Config::RELAXED)
  ```

  2. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Add strict CSP
     headers to prevent inline JavaScript execution:
  ```
     Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
  ```

  3. **Input validation**: If possible, validate and sanitize
     ProseMirror documents before conversion to prevent malicious
     content from entering the system.
