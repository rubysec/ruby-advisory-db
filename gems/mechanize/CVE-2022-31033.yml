title: Authorization header leak on port redirect in mechanize
date: 2022-06-09
description: |
  **Summary**

  Mechanize (rubygem) `< v2.8.5` leaks the `Authorization` header after a
  redirect to a different port on the same site.

  **Mitigation**

  Upgrade to Mechanize v2.8.5 or later.

  **Notes**

  See [https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html](CVE-2022-27776) for a similar vulnerability in curl.

  Cookies are shared with a server at a different port on the same site, per
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-8.5 which states in part:

  > Cookies do not provide isolation by port.  If a cookie is readable
  > by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a
  > service running on another port of the same server.  If a cookie is
  > writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a
  > service running on another port of the same server.  For this
  > reason, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on
  > different ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-
  > sensitive information.
