title: pubnub Insufficient Entropy vulnerability
date: 2023-12-06
description: |
  Versions of the package pubnub before 7.4.0; all versions of the
  package com.pubnub:pubnub; versions of the package pubnub before
  6.19.0; all versions of the package github.com/pubnub/go; versions
  of the package github.com/pubnub/go/v7 before 7.2.0; versions of
  the package pubnub before 7.3.0; versions of the package pubnub/pubnub
  before 6.1.0; versions of the package pubnub before 5.3.0; versions
  of the package pubnub before 0.4.0; versions of the package pubnub/c-core
  before 4.5.0; versions of the package com.pubnub:pubnub-kotlin before
  7.7.0; versions of the package pubnub/swift before 6.2.0; versions
  of the package pubnub before 5.2.0; versions of the package pubnub
  before 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy via the getKey
  function, due to inefficient implementation of the AES-256-CBC
  cryptographic algorithm. The provided encrypt function is less secure
  when hex encoding and trimming are applied, leaving half of the bits
  in the key always the same for every encoded message or file.

  **Note:**

  In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to invest
  resources in preparing the attack and brute-force the encryption.
