title: Arbitrary path traversal and file access via `yard server`
description: |
  A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in YARD <= 0.9.19 when using
  `yard server` to serve documentation. This bug would allow unsanitized HTTP
  requests to access arbitrary files on the machine of a yard server host under
  certain conditions.

  The issue is resolved in v0.9.20 and later.
