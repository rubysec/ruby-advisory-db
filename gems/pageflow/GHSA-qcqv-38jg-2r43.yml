title: Pageflow vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in membership update endpoint
date: 2022-09-15
description: |
  ### Impact

  Pageflow has a membership edit feature which allows users to edit the roles of user
  memberships associated with an account that they have the `manager` role to (including
  their own). While the `Entity` dropdown select field is greyed out in the UI, an attacker
  can use tools which allow sending arbitrary HTTP request to craft a request to the
  `/admin/users/{user_id}/memberships/{membership_id}` endpoint containing an additional
  `membership[entity_id]` parameter. This parameter is honored when the membership is
  updated, allowing an attacker to update the membership object associated with their own
  account (with `manager` role) to be associated with a different attacker-chosen account
  instead. Since `account_id`s are enumerable, an attacker can compromise all accounts
  present on the platform.

  ### Mitigation

  Upgrade to version 15.7.1 or 14.5.2 of the `pageflow` gem.
patched_versions:
  - "~> 14.5.2"
  - ">= 15.7.1"
