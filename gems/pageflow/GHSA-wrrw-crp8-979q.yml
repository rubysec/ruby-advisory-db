title: Pageflow vulnerable to sensitive user data extraction via Ransack query injection
date: 2022-09-15
description: |
  ### Impact

  The attack allows extracting sensitive properties of database objects that are
  associated with users or entries belonging to an account that the attacker has access
  to.

  Pageflow uses the `ActiveAdmin` Ruby library to provide some management features to
  its users. `ActiveAdmin` relies on the `Ransack` library to implement search
  functionality. In its default configuration, `Ransack` will allow for query conditions
  based on properties of associated database objects [1]. The `*_starts_with`,
  `*_ends_with` or `*_contains` search matchers [2] can then be abused to exfiltrate
  sensitive string values of associated database objects via character-by-character
  brute-force.
