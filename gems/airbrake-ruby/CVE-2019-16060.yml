title: Blacklist keys are no longer being filtered in airbrake-ruby
date: 2019-04-10
description: |
  A flaw in airbrake-ruby v4.2.3 prevented user data from being filtered
  prior to sending to Airbrake. Such data could be user passwords. Therefore, an app
  could leak user passwords without knowing it.
