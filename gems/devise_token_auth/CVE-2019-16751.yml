title: Devise Token Auth vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
date: 2022-05-24
description: |
  An issue was discovered in Devise Token Auth through 1.1.2. The omniauth
  failure endpoint is vulnerable to Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through the
  message parameter. Unauthenticated attackers can craft a URL that executes a malicious
  JavaScript payload in the victim's browser. This affects the fallback_render method
  in the omniauth callbacks controller.
