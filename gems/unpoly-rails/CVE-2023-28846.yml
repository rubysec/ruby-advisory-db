title: unpoly-rails Denial of Service vulnerability
date: 2023-03-30
description: |
  There is a possible Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the unpoly-rails
  gem that implements the [Unpoly server protocol](https://unpoly.com/up.protocol)
  for Rails applications.

  ### Impact

  This issues affects Rails applications
  that operate as an upstream of a load balancer's that uses [passive health
  checks](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-health-check/#passive-health-checks).

  The [unpoly-rails](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly-rails/) gem echoes the request URL
  as an `X-Up-Location` response header. By making a request with exceedingly long
  URLs (paths or query string), an attacker can cause unpoly-rails to write a exceedingly
  large response header.

  If the response header is too large to be parsed by a load balancer downstream
  of the Rails application, it may cause the load balancer to remove the upstream
  from a load balancing group. This causes that application instance to become
  unavailable until a configured timeout is reached or until an active healthcheck
  succeeds.

  ### Workarounds

  If you cannot upgrade to a fixed release, several workarounds are available:

  - Configure your load balancer to
    use active health checks, e.g. by periodically requesting a route with a known response
    that indicates healthiness.
  - Configure your load balancer so the [maximum size
    of response headers](https://makandracards.com/operations/537537-nginx-proxy-buffer-tuning)
    is at least twice the [maximum size of a URL](https://tryhexadecimal.com/guides/http/414-request-uri-too-long).
  - Instead of changing your server configuration you may also configure your Rails
    application to delete redundant `X-Up-Location` headers set by unpoly-rails:

    ```ruby
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

      after_action :remove_redundant_up_location_header

      private

      def remove_redundant_up_location_header
        if request.original_url == response.headers['X-Up-Location']
          response.headers.delete('X-Up-Location')
        end
      end

    end
  ```
