title: Denial of Service in rubyzip ("zip bombs")
date: 2019-09-12
description: |
  In Rubyzip before 1.3.0, a crafted ZIP file can bypass application
  checks on ZIP entry sizes because data about the uncompressed size
  can be spoofed. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service
  (disk consumption).
patched_versions:
- '>= 1.3.0'
