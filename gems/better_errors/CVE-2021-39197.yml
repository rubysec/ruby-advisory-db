title: Older releases of better_errors open to Cross-Site Request Forgery attack
date: 2021-09-07
description: |
  ### Impact
  better_errors prior to 2.8.0 did not implement CSRF protection for its internal requests. It also did not enforce the correct "Content-Type" header for these requests, which allowed a cross-origin "simple request" to be made without CORS protection. These together left an application with better_errors enabled open to cross-origin attacks.

  _As a developer tool, better_errors documentation strongly recommends addition only to the `development` bundle group, so this vulnerability should only affect development environments. Please ensure that your project limits better_errors to the `development` group (or the non-Rails equivalent)._

  ### Patches
  Starting with release 2.8.x, CSRF protection is enforced. It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest release, or minimally to "~> 2.8.3".

  ### Workarounds
  There are no known workarounds to mitigate the risk of using older releases of better_errors.
