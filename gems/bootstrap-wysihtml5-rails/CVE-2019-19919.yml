title: Prototype Pollution in handlebars
date: 2019-12-26
description: |
  The bootstrap-wysihtml5-rails gem includes the vendored JavaScript library 'handlebars.js'.
  Versions 0.3.3.7-0.3.3.8 include handlebars 3.0.2, and versions 0.3.3.5-0.3.3.6 include handlebars 1.3.0.

  Versions Affected: 0.3.3.5-0.3.3.8
  Not affected: < 0.3.3.5
  Fixed Versions: None

  Versions of handlebars prior to 3.0.8 or 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution.
  Templates may alter an Objects' __proto__ and __defineGetter__ properties, which may allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary code through crafted payloads.
cvss_v3: 9.8
unaffected_versions:
