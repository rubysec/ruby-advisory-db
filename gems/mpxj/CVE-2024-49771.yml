title: MPXJ has a Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability
date: 2024-10-28
description: |
  ### Impact

  The patch for the historical vulnerability CVE-2020-35460 in MPXJ
  is incomplete as there is still a possibility that a malicious path
  could be constructed which would not be picked up by the original
  fix and allow files to be written to arbitrary locations.

  ### Patches

  The issue is addressed in MPXJ version 13.5.1

  ### Workarounds

  Do not pass zip files to MPXJ.
