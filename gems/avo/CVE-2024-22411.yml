title: Cross-site scripting (XSS) in Action messages on Avo
date: 2024-01-17
description: |
  Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps.
  In Avo 3 pre12 any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or
  `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly
  without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the
  UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this
  vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an
  unsuspecting user.

  This issue has been addressed in the 3.0.2 release of Avo. Users
  are advised to upgrade.
