title: Nokogiri gem, via libxml, is affected by DoS and RCE vulnerabilities
date: 2017-09-19
description: |
  The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains several
  vulnerabilities. Nokogiri has mitigated these issues by upgrading to
  libxml 2.9.5.

  It was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An
  attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that
  could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2017-0663)

  It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity
  references. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML
  data that could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375)

  It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in libxml2 when
  handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use this to specially
  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376)

  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overflow in
  libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this to specially
  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047)

  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread
  in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this
  to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2017-9048)

  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads
  in libxml2 when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker
  could use these to specially construct XML data that could cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)
