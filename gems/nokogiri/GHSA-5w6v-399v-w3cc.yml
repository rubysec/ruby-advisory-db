title: Nokogiri updates packaged libxml2 to v2.13.8 to resolve
  CVE-2025-32414 and CVE-2025-32415
date: 2025-04-21
description: |
  ## Summary

  Nokogiri v1.18.8 upgrades its dependency libxml2 to
  [v2.13.8](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.13.8).

  libxml2 v2.13.8 addresses:

  - CVE-2025-32414
    - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/889
  - CVE-2025-32415
    - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/890

  ## Impact

  ### CVE-2025-32414: No impact

  In libxml2 before 2.13.8 and 2.14.x before 2.14.2, out-of-bounds
  memory access can occur in the Python API (Python bindings) because
  of an incorrect return value. This occurs in xmlPythonFileRead and
  xmlPythonFileReadRaw because of a difference between bytes and characters.

  **There is no impact** from this CVE for Nokogiri users.

  ### CVE-2025-32415: Low impact

  In libxml2 before 2.13.8 and 2.14.x before 2.14.2,
  xmlSchemaIDCFillNodeTables in xmlschemas.c has a heap-based buffer
  under-read. To exploit this, a crafted XML document must be validated
  against an XML schema with certain identity constraints, or a
  crafted XML schema must be used.

  In the upstream issue, further context is provided by the maintainer:

  > The bug affects validation against untrusted XML Schemas (.xsd)
  > and validation of untrusted documents against trusted Schemas if
  > they make use of xsd:keyref in combination with recursively
  > defined types that have additional identity constraints.

  MITRE has published a severity score of 2.9 LOW
  (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) for this CVE.
