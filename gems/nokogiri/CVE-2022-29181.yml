title: Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type in Nokogiri
date: 2022-05-23
description: |
  ### Summary

  Nokogiri `< v1.13.6` does not type-check all inputs into the XML and HTML4 SAX parsers.
  For CRuby users, this may allow specially crafted untrusted inputs to cause illegal
  memory access errors (segfault) or reads from unrelated memory.

  ### Severity

  The Nokogiri maintainers have evaluated this as **High 8.2** (CVSS3.1).

  ### Mitigation

  CRuby users should upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.6`.

  JRuby users are not affected.

  ### Workarounds

  To avoid this vulnerability in affected applications, ensure the untrusted input is a
  `String` by calling `#to_s` or equivalent.
