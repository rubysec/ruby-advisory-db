  ## Impact

  ### CVE-2025-24928

  Stack-buffer overflow is possible when reporting DTD validation
  errors if the input contains a long (~3kb) QName prefix.

  ### CVE-2024-56171

  Use-after-free is possible during validation against untrusted
  XML Schemas (.xsd) and, potentially, validation of untrusted documents
  against trusted Schemas if they make use of `xsd:keyref` in combination
  with recursively defined types that have additional identity constraints.
