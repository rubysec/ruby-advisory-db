title: Out-of-bounds Write in zlib affects Nokogiri
date: 2022-04-11
description: |
  ## Summary

  Nokogiri v1.13.4 updates the vendored zlib from 1.2.11
  to 1.2.12, which addresses [CVE-2018-25032](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25032).
  That CVE is scored as CVSS 7.4 "High" on the NVD record as of 2022-04-05.

  Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of
  Nokogiri `< 1.13.4`, and only if the packaged version of `zlib` is being used.
  Please see [this document](https://nokogiri.org/LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.html#default-platform-release-ruby)
  for a complete description of which platform gems vendor `zlib`. If you've
  overridden defaults at installation time to use system libraries instead of
  packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `zlib`
  release announcements.

  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to Nokogiri `>= v1.13.4`.
