title: Revert libxml2 behavior in Nokogiri gem that could cause XSS
description: |
  [MRI] Behavior in libxml2 has been reverted which caused
  CVE-2018-8048 (loofah gem), CVE-2018-3740 (sanitize gem), and
  CVE-2018-3741 (rails-html-sanitizer gem). The commit in question is
  here:

  https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2/commit/960f0e2

  and more information is available about this commit and its impact
  here:

  https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/144

  This release simply reverts the libxml2 commit in question to protect
  users of Nokogiri's vendored libraries from similar vulnerabilities.

  If you're offended by what happened here, I'd kindly ask that you
  comment on the upstream bug report here:
