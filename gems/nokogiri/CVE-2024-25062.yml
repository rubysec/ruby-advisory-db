title: Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type in Nokogiri

  ### Summary

  Nokogiri v1.16.2 upgrades the version of its dependency libxml2 to v2.12.5.

  libxml2 v2.12.5 addresses the following vulnerability:

  CVE-2024-25062 / https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25062
  described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/604
  patched by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/92721970

  Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of
  Nokogiri < 1.16.2, and only if the packaged libraries are being used. If
  you've overridden defaults at installation time to use system libraries
  instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your
  distro's libxml2 release announcements.

  ### Severity

  The Nokogiri maintainers have evaluated this as **Moderate**.

  ### Mitigation

  Upgrade to Nokogiri >= 1.16.2.

  Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated
  mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 >=
  2.12.5 which will also address these same issues.

  JRuby users are not affected.
