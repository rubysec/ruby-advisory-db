title: libxml2 2.9.10 has an infinite loop in a certain end-of-file situation
description: |-

  CVE-2019-19956 was addressed in upstream libxml2 release v2.9.10, which has
  been vendored in Nokogiri since v1.10.5 on 2019-10-31.

  CVE-2020-7595 has not yet been addressed in an upstream libxml2 release, and
  so Nokogiri versions <= v1.10.7 are vulnerable.

  Nokogiri has backported the patch for CVE-2020-7595 into its vendored version
  of libxml2, and released this as v1.10.8

patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.10.8"

cvss_v2: 5.0
cvss_v3: 7.5
