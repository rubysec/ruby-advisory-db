title: Arbitrary file write/potential remote code execution in actionpack-page_caching
date: 2020-05-06
description: |
  There is a vulnerability in the actionpack-page_caching gem that allows an attacker
  to write arbitrary files to a web server, potentially resulting in remote code execution
  if the attacker can write unescaped ERB to a view.

  Versions Affected:  All versions of actionpack-page_caching (part of Rails prior to Rails 4.0)
  Not affected:       Applications not using actionpack-page_caching
  Fixed Versions:     actionpack-page_caching >= 1.2.1

  Impact
  ------

  The Action Pack Page Caching gem writes cache files to the file system in
  order for the front end webserver (nginx, Apache, etc) to serve the cached
  file without making a request to the application server.  Paths contain what
  is effectively user input can be used to manipulate the location of the cache
  file.

  For example "/users/123" could be changed to "/users/../../../foo" and this
  will escape the cache directory.  Attackers can use this technique to
  springboard to an RCE if they can write arbitrary ERb to a view folder.

  Impacted code looks like this:

  ```
  class BooksController < ApplicationController
    caches_page :show
  end
  ```

  Where the `show` action of the `BooksController` may be vulnerable.
