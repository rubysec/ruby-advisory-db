title: brbackup Gem for Ruby /lib/brbackup.rb name Parameter SQL Injection
date: 2014-07-09
description: |
  brbackup Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL
  injection attack. The issue is due to the /lib/brbackup.rb script not
  properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'name' parameter. This may
  allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end
  database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
notes: "Never patched"
