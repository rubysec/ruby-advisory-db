title: Use of Uninitialized Variable in trilogy
date: 2022-06-06
description: |
  ### Impact

  When authenticating, a malicious server could return a specially crafted authentication
  packet, causing the client to read and return up to 12 bytes of data from an
  uninitialized variable in stack memory.

  ### Patches

  Users of the trilogy gem should upgrade to version 2.1.1

  ### Workarounds

  This issue can be avoided by only connecting to trusted servers.
