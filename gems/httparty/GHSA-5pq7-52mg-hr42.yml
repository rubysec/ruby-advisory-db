title: httparty has multipart/form-data request tampering vulnerability
date: 2023-01-03
description: |
  "multipart/form-data request tampering vulnerability"
  caused by Content-Disposition "filename" lack of escaping in httparty.

  `httparty/lib/httparty/request` > `body.rb` > `def generate_multipart`

  https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/blob/4416141d37fd71bdba4f37589ec265f55aa446ce/lib/httparty/request/body.rb#L43

  By exploiting this problem, the following attacks are possible

  * An attack that rewrites the \"name\" field according to the crafted file
  name, impersonating (overwriting) another field.
  * Attacks that rewrite the filename extension at the time multipart/form-data
  is generated by tampering with the filename.
