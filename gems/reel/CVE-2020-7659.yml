title: HTTP Request Smuggling in reel
description: |
  reel through 0.6.1 allows Request Smuggling attacks due to incorrect
  Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing. It is possible to conduct HTTP
  request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice. Furthermore,
  invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be
  leveraged for TECL smuggling attacks. Note, This project is deprecated, and is not
  maintained any more.
