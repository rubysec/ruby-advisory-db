title: Remote code execution in bootstrap-sass
date: 2019-04-04
description: |
  Arbitrary code execution (via backdoor code, when
  downloaded from rubygems.org) was discovered in
  bootstrap-sass 3.2.0.3.

  Users are advised to upgrade immediately to 3.2.0.4

  An unauthenticated attacker can craft the ___cfduid cookie value
  with base64 arbitrary code to be executed via eval(), which can
  be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
  (Note that there are three underscore characters in the cookie name.
  This is unrelated to the __cfduid cookie that is legitimately used by
  Cloudflare.)
unaffected_versions:
- <= 3.2.0.2
patched_versions:
- '>= 3.2.0.4'
