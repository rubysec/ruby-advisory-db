title: "Paperclip: Access Restriction Bypass"
date: 2014-01-31
description: |
  Paperclip Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the application
  failing to properly validate the file extension, instead only validating the Content-Type
  header during file uploads. This may allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions
  on file types for uploaded files by spoofing the content-type.
patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.0.0"
