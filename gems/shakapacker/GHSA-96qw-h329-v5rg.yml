title: Shakapacker has environment variable leak via EnvironmentPlugin
  that exposes secrets to client-side bundles
date: 2026-01-08
description: |
  ### Summary

  Since 2017, the default webpack plugins have passed the entire
  `process.env` to `EnvironmentPlugin`. This pattern exposed ALL
  build environment variables to client-side JavaScript bundles
  whenever application code (or any dependency) referenced
  `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

  This is not a regression - the vulnerable code has existed since
  the original Webpacker implementation. No recent code change
  in Shakapacker triggered this issue.

  ### Impact

  Any environment variable in the build environment that is referenced
  in client-side code (including third-party dependencies) is embedded
  directly into the JavaScript bundle. This includes:

  - `DATABASE_URL` - Database credentials
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS credentials
  - `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` - Rails encrypted credentials key
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Third-party API keys
  - Any other secrets present in the build environment

  **Severity**: Critical - secrets are exposed in publicly accessible
  JavaScript files.

  ### Root Cause

  The original code used:
  ```javascript
  new
  webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(process.env)
  ```

  This makes every environment variable available for substitution. If
  any code references `process.env.SECRET_KEY`, that value is embedded
  in the bundle.

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to version 9.5.0 or later, which uses an allowlist approach
  that only exposes `NODE_ENV`, `RAILS_ENV`, and `WEBPACK_SERVE` by default.

  ### Workarounds

  If developers cannot upgrade immediately:
    1. Audit client-side code and dependencies for any `process.env.X`
       references to sensitive variables
    2. Remove sensitive variables from the build environment
    3. Override the default plugins with a custom webpack/rspack
       config using an explicit allowlist

  ### Migration

  After upgrading, if client-side code needs access to specific environment
  variables:

  **Option 1: Use the `SHAKAPACKER_PUBLIC_` prefix (recommended)**
  ```bash
  # Variables with this prefix are automatically exposed
  export SHAKAPACKER_PUBLIC_API_URL=\"https://api.example.com\"
  ```

  **Option 2: Use `SHAKAPACKER_ENV_VARS`**
  ```bash
  SHAKAPACKER_ENV_VARS=API_URL,FEATURE_FLAG
  bundle exec rails assets:precompile
  ```

  ### Action Required

  After upgrading, **rotate any secrets** that may have been exposed
  in previously compiled JavaScript bundles.
