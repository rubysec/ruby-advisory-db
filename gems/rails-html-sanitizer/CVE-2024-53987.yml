title: rails-html-sanitizer has XSS vulnerability with certain configurations
date: 2024-12-02
description: |
  ## Summary

  There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
  Rails::HTML::Sanitizer 1.6.0 when used with Rails >= 7.1.0.

  * Versions affected: 1.6.0
  * Not affected: < 1.6.0
  * Fixed versions: 1.6.1

  ## Impact

  A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
  Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if
  HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has
  overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in the following way:

  - the "style" element is explicitly allowed
  - the "svg" or "math" element is not allowed

  Code is only impacted if Rails is configured to use HTML5 sanitization,
  please see documentation for [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor)
  and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor)
  for more information on these configuration options.

  The default configuration is to disallow all of these elements. Code
  is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. Applications
  may be doing this in a few different ways:

  1. using application configuration to configure Action View sanitizers'
     allowed tags:

    ```ruby
    # In config/application.rb
    config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["style"]
    ```

    see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-view

  2. using a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:

    ```
    <= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["style"] >
    ```

    see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize

  3. setting Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer class attribute `allowed_tags`:

    ```ruby
    # class-level option
    Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["style"]
    ```

    (note that this class may also be referenced as
    `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

  4. using a `:tags` options to the Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer instance method `sanitize`:

    ```ruby
    # instance-level option
    Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["style"])
    ```

    (note that this class may also be referenced as
    `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

  5. setting ActionText::ContentHelper module attribute `allowed_tags`:

    ```ruby
    ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["style"]
    ```

  All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms
  to include "style" and omit "svg" or "math" should either upgrade
  or use one of the workarounds.

  ## Workarounds

  Any one of the following actions will work around this issue:

  - Remove "style" from the overridden allowed tags,
  - Or, downgrade sanitization to HTML4 (see documentation for
    [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor)
    and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor)
    for more information).
