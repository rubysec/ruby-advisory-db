title: rails-html-sanitizer has XSS vulnerability with certain configurations
date: 2024-12-02
description: |
  ## Summary

  There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
  Rails::HTML::Sanitizer 1.6.0 when used with Rails >= 7.1.0 and
  Nokogiri < 1.15.7, or 1.16.x < 1.16.8.

  * Versions affected: 1.6.0
  * Not affected: < 1.6.0
  * Fixed versions: 1.6.1

  Please note that the fix in v1.6.1 is to update the dependency on
  Nokogiri to 1.15.7 or >= 1.16.8.

  ## Impact

  A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
  Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if
  HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has
  overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in either of the following ways:

  * allow both "math" and "style" elements
  * or allow both "svg" and "style" elements

  Code is only impacted if Rails is configured to use HTML5 sanitization,
  please see documentation for
  [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor)
  and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor)
  for more information on these configuration options.

  Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden.
  Applications may be doing this in a few different ways:

  1. using application configuration to configure Action View
     sanitizers' allowed tags:

    ```ruby
    # In config/application.rb
    config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
    # or
    config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
    ```

    see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-view

  2. using a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:

    ```
    <= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["math", "style"] >
    <# or>
    <= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["svg", "style"] >
    ```

    see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize

  3. setting Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer class attribute `allowed_tags`:

    ```ruby
    # class-level option
    Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
    # or
    Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
    ```

    (note that this class may also be referenced as
    `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

  4. using a `:tags` options to the Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer
     instance method `sanitize`:

    ```ruby
    # instance-level option
    Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["math", "style"])
    # or
    Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["svg", "style"])
    ```
    (note that this class may also be referenced as `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

  5. setting ActionText::ContentHelper module attribute `allowed_tags`:

    ```ruby
    ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
    # or
    ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
    ```

  All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms
  to include (("math" or "svg") and "style") should either upgrade or
  use one of the workarounds.

  ## Workarounds

  Any one of the following actions will work around this issue:

  - Remove "style" from the overridden allowed tags,
  - Or, remove "math" and "svg" from the overridden allowed tags,
  - Or, downgrade sanitization to HTML4 (see documentation for
    [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor)
    and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor)
    for more information)
  - Or, independently upgrade Nokogiri to v1.15.7 or >= 1.16.8.
