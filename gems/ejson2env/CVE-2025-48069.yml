title: Insufficient input sanitization in ejson2env
date: 2025-05-21
description: |
  ### Summary
  The `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to
  `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export
  statement for environment variables and their values. However, due
  to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where
  variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting
  in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this
  output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could
  lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to
  execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

  ### Details
  The vulnerability exists because environment variables are not
  properly sanitized during the decryption phase, which enables
  malicious keys or encrypted values to inject commands.

  ### Impact
  An attacker with control over `.ejson` files can inject commands
  in the environment where `source $(ejson2env)` or `eval ejson2env`
  are executed.

  ### Mitigation
  - Update to a version of `ejson2env` that sanitizes the output
    during decryption or
  - Do not use `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets or
  - Do not evaluate or execute the direct output from `ejson2env`
    without removing nonprintable characters.
