title: Doorkeeper application secret information disclosure vulnerability
description: |
  Information disclosure vulnerability. Allows an attacker to see all
  Doorkeeper::Application model attribute values (including secrets) after
  authorizing an application to their user.

  An application is vulnerable if the authorized applications controller is
  enabled (GET /oauth/authorized_applications.json).

  Recommended additional hardening for >= 5.1 is to enable application secrets
  hashing. This would render the exposed secret useless.
