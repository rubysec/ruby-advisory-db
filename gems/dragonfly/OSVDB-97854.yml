title: Dragonfly Gem for Ruby on Windows Shell Escaping Weakness
date: 2011-09-01
description: |
  Dragonfly Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program
  failing to properly escape a shell that contains injected characters.
  This may allow a context-dependent attacker to potentially execute
  arbitrary commands.
