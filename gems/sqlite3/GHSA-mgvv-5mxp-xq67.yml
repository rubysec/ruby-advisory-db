title: SQLite3 addresses vulnerability in packaged version of libsqlite
date: 2022-10-03
description: |
  ### Summary

  The rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 upgrades the packaged version of libsqlite from
  v3.39.3 to [v3.39.4](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_4.html).

  libsqlite v3.39.4 addresses a vulnerability described as follows in the
  release notification:

  > Version 3.39.4 is a minimal patch against the prior release that addresses
  > issues found since the prior release. In particular, a potential
  > vulnerability in the FTS3 extension has been fixed, so this should be
  > considered a security update.
  >
  > In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have full SQL access
  > and must be able to construct a corrupt database with over 2GB of FTS3
  > content. The problem arises from a 32-bit signed integer overflow.

  This vulnerability has not been assigned a CVE and does not have a severity
  declared.

  Please note that this advisory only applies to the sqlite3 gem v1.5.0, and
  only if the packaged libsqlite is being used. If you've overridden defaults at
  installation time to use system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you
  should instead pay attention to your distro's libsqlite release announcements.


  ### Mitigation

  Upgrade to the rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 or later.

  Users who are unable to upgrade the sqlite3 gem may also choose a more
  complicated mitigation: compile and link sqlite3 against external libsqlite >=
  3.39.4 which will also address these same issues.
