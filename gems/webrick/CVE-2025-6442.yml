  Ruby WEBrick read_header HTTP Request Smuggling Vulnerability

  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to smuggle arbitrary HTTP
  requests on affected installations of Ruby WEBrick. This issue is
  exploitable when the product is deployed behind an HTTP proxy that
  fulfills specific conditions.

  The specific flaw exists within the read_headers method. The issue
  results from the inconsistent parsing of terminators of HTTP headers.
  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to smuggle arbitrary
  HTTP requests. Was ZDI-CAN-21876.
