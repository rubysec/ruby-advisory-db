title: HTTP Request Smuggling in ruby webrick
date: 2024-09-22
description: |
  An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby.
  It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length
  header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g.,
  "GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\n" inside of a "POST /user HTTP/1.1\r\n"
  request.

  NOTE: the supplier''s position is "Webrick should not be used in production."
cvss_v3: 7.5
notes: Never patched
