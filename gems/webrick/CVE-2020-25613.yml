title: Potential HTTP Request Smuggling Vulnerability in WEBrick
date: 2020-09-29
description: |
  WEBrick was too tolerant against an invalid Transfer-Encoding header. This may lead to
  inconsistent interpretation between WEBrick and some HTTP proxy servers, which may
  allow the attacker to "smuggle" a request. See CWE-444 in detail.
