title: Potential denial of service in bson rubygem
description: |
  The Moped::BSON::ObjecId.legal? method in mongodb/bson-ruby before 3.0.4
  as used in rubygem-moped allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker
  resource consumption) via a crafted string. NOTE: This issue is due to an incomplete
  fix to CVE-2015-4410.
