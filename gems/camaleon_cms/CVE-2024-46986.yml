title: Camaleon CMS affected by arbitrary file write to RCE (GHSL-2024-182)
date: 2024-09-18
description: |
  An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method
  of the `MediaController` allows authenticated users to write arbitrary
  files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on
  (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem).
  E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an
  attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the `config/initializers/`
  subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application.

  Once a user upload is started via the [upload] method, the
  `file_upload` and the folder parameter.

  [upload]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L86-L87

  ```ruby
  def upload(settings = {})
    params[:dimension] = nil if params[:skip_auto_crop].present?
    f = { error: 'File not found.' }
    if params[:file_upload].present?
      f = upload_file(params[:file_upload],
                      { folder: params[:folder], dimension: params['dimension'], formats: params[:formats], versions: params[:versions],
                        thumb_size: params[:thumb_size] }.merge(settings))
    end
    [..]
  end
  ```

  are passed to the [upload_file] method. Inside that method the
  given settings are [merged] with some presets. The file format
  is [checked against] the formats settings we can override with
  the formats parameters.

  [upload_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L23-L24
  [merged]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L41-L42
  [checked against]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L61-L62

  ```ruby
  # formats validations
    return { error: "#{ct('file_format_error')} (#{settings[:formats]})" } unless cama_uploader.class.validate_file_format(
      uploaded_io.path, settings[:formats]
   )
  ```

  Our given folder is then [passed unchecked] to the `Cama_uploader`:

  [passed unchecked]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/helpers/camaleon_cms/uploader_helper.rb#L73-L74

  ```ruby
  key = File.join(settings[:folder], settings[:filename]).to_s.cama_fix_slash
  res = cama_uploader.add_file(settings[:uploaded_io], key, { same_name: settings[:same_name] })
  ```

  In the [add_file] method of `CamaleonCmsLocalUploader` this key argument containing the
  unchecked path is then used to write the file to the file system:

  [add_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/uploaders/camaleon_cms_local_uploader.rb#L77

  ```ruby
  def add_file(uploaded_io_or_file_path, key, args = {})
    [..]
    upload_io = uploaded_io_or_file_path.is_a?(String) ? File.open(uploaded_io_or_file_path) : uploaded_io_or_file_path
    File.open(File.join(@root_folder, key), 'wb') { |file| file.write(upload_io.read) }
    [..]
  end
  ```

  ## Impact

  This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via arbitrary
  file write.

  ## Remediation

  Normalize file paths constructed from untrusted user input before using
  them and check that the resulting path is inside the targeted directory.
  Additionally, do not allow character sequences such as `..` in untrusted
  input that is used to build paths.
