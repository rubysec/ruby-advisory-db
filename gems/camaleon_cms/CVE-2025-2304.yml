  A Privilege Escalation through a Mass Assignment exists in Camaleon CMS

  When a user wishes to change his password, the 'updated_ajax' method
  of the UsersController is called. The vulnerability stems from the
  use of the dangerous permit! method, which allows all parameters to
  pass through without any filtering.
