title: Camaleon CMS vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
date: 2022-05-24
description: |
  In Camaleon CMS, versions 2.1.2.0 through 2.6.0, are vulnerable to Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF) in the media upload feature, which allows admin users to
  fetch media files from external URLs but fails to validate URLs referencing to localhost
  or other internal servers. This allows attackers to read files stored in the internal
  server.
