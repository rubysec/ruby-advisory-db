title: Security Vulnerability in Nested Attributes code in Ruby On Rails 2.3.9 and 3.0.0
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  Ruby on Rails 2.3.9 and 3.0.0 does not properly handle nested
  attributes, which allows remote attackers to modify arbitrary
  records by changing the names of parameters for form inputs.

  Patches are available for 2.3 and 3.0 series.
