title: "CVE-2014-3482 rubygem-activerecord: SQL injection vulnerability in 'bitstring'\
  \ quoting"
date: 2014-07-02
description: SQL injection vulnerability in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb
  in the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record in Ruby on Rails 2.x and 3.x before
  3.2.19 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by leveraging improper
  bitstring quoting. It was discovered that Active Record did not properly quote values
  of the bitstring type attributes when using the PostgreSQL database adapter. A remote
  attacker could possibly use this flaw to conduct an SQL injection attack against
  applications using Active Record.
