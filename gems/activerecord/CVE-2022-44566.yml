title: Denial of Service Vulnerability in ActiveRecord’s PostgreSQL adapter
date: 2023-01-18
description: |
  There is a potential denial of service vulnerability present in
  ActiveRecord’s PostgreSQL adapter.

  This has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-44566.

  Versions Affected: All.
  Not affected: None.
  Fixed Versions: 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1

  # Impact

  In ActiveRecord <7.0.4.1 and <6.1.7.1, when a value outside the range for a
  64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it
  will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values
  against numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in
  potential Denial of Service.

  # Workarounds

  Ensure that user supplied input which is provided to ActiveRecord clauses do
  not contain integers wider than a signed 64bit representation or floats.
