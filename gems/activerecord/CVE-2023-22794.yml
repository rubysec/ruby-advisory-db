title: SQL Injection Vulnerability via ActiveRecord comments
date: 2023-01-18
description: |
  There is a possible vulnerability in ActiveRecord related to the
  sanitization of comments. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
  identifier CVE-2023-22794.

  Versions Affected: >= 6.0.0
  Not affected: < 6.0.0
  Fixed Versions: 6.0.6.1, 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1

  # Impact

  Previously the implementation of escaping for comments was insufficient for

  If malicious user input is passed to either the annotate query method, the
  optimizer_hints query method, or through the QueryLogs interface which
  automatically adds annotations, it may be sent to the database with
  insufficient sanitization and be able to inject SQL outside of the comment.

  In most cases these interfaces won’t be used with user input and users
  should avoid doing so.

  Example vulnerable code:
  ```
  Post.where(id: 1).annotate("#{params[:user_input]}")

  Post.where(id: 1).optimizer_hints("#{params[:user_input]}")
  ```

  Example vulnerable QueryLogs configuration (the default configuration is not
  vulnerable):
  ```
  config.active_record.query_log_tags = [
    {
      something: -> { <some value including user input> }
    }
  ]
  ```
  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  # Workarounds

  Avoid passing user input to annotate and avoid using QueryLogs configuration
  which can include user input.
