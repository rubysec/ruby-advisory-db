title: Potential SQL Injection with limit in rails/activerecord
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not ensure that arguments to
  the limit function specify integer values, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a
  non-numeric argument.
