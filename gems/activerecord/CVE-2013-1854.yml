title: 'CVE-2013-1854 rubygem-activerecord: attribute_dos Symbol DoS vulnerability'
date: 2013-03-19
description: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x before 2.3.18, 3.1.x
  before 3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.13 processes certain queries by converting hash
  keys to symbols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via
  crafted input to a where method. A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled
  hashes in certain queries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial
  of service (resource consumption) attack by sending specially crafted queries that
  would result in the creation of Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected.
