title: 'CVE-2012-2661 rubygem-activerecord: SQL injection when processing nested query
  paramaters'
date: 2012-05-31
description: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x
  before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of
  request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers
  to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
  unintended recursion, a related issue to CVE-2012-2695.
