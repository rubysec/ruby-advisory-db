title: Incorrect value comparison in Ruby openssl
date: 2018-10-17
description: |
  An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby when two OpenSSL::X509::Name
  objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may
  return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or
  the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the
  same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be
  leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate
  and then used in signing or encryption operations.
