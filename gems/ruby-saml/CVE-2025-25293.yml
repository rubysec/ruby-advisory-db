title: Ruby SAML allows remote Denial of Service (DoS) with compressed SAML responses
date: 2025-03-12
description: |-
  ### Summary
  ruby-saml is susceptible to remote Denial of Service (DoS) with compressed SAML responses.

  Ruby-saml uses zlib to decompress SAML responses in case they're compressed.
  It is possible to bypass the message size check with a compressed assertion
  since the message size is checked before inflation and not after.

  ### Impact
  This issue may lead to remote Denial of Service (DoS).
