title: Ruby SAML DOS vulnerability with large SAML response
date: 2025-07-30
description: |
  ### Summary

  A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in ruby-saml even with the
  message_max_bytesize setting configured. The vulnerability occurs
  because the SAML response is validated for Base64 format prior to
  checking the message size,  leading to potential resource exhaustion.

  ### Details

  `ruby-saml` includes a `message_max_bytesize` setting intended to
  prevent DOS attacks and decompression bombs. However, this protection
  is ineffective in some cases due to the order of operations in the code:

  https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/blob/fbbedc978300deb9355a8e505849666974ef2e67/lib/onelogin/ruby-saml/saml_message.rb

  ```ruby
       def decode_raw_saml(saml, settings = nil)
          return saml unless base64_encoded?(saml)
  # <--- Issue here. Should be moved after next code block.

          settings =  OneLogin::RubySaml::Settings.new if settings.nil?
          if saml.bytesize > settings.message_max_bytesize
             raise ValidationError.new(\"Encoded SAML Message exceeds \" +
             settings.message_max_bytesize.to_s +
             \" bytes, so was rejected\")
          end
          decoded = decode(saml)
        ...
        end
  ```

  The vulnerability is in the execution order. Prior to checking
  bytesize the `base64_encoded?` function performs regex matching
  on the entire input string:

  ```ruby
  !!string.gsub(/[\\r\]|\\\\r|\\\|\\s/, \"\").match(BASE64_FORMAT)
  ```

  ### Impact

  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  When successfully  exploited, this vulnerability can lead to:
  - Excessive memory consumption
  - High CPU utilization
  - Application slowdown or unresponsiveness
  - Complete application crash in severe cases
  - Potential denial of service for legitimate users

  All applications using `ruby-saml` with SAML configured and
  enabled are vulnerable.

  ###   Potential Solution

  Reorder the validation steps to ensure max bytesize is checked first

  ```ruby
  def decode_raw_saml(saml, settings = nil)
    settings = OneLogin::RubySaml::Settings.new
  if settings.nil?
    if saml.bytesize > settings.message_max_bytesize
      raise  ValidationError.new(\"Encoded SAML Message exceeds \" +
      settings.message_max_bytesize.to_s  + \" bytes, so was rejected\")
    end
    return saml unless base64_encoded?(saml)
    decoded = decode(saml)
    ...
  end
  ```
