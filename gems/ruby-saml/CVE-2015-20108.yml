title: ruby-saml gem is vulnerable to XPath injection
date: 2015-04-29
description: |
  xml_security.rb in the ruby-saml gem before 1.0.0 for Ruby
  allows XPath injection and code execution because prepared
  statements are not used.

  The lack of prepared statements allows for possibly command
  injection, leading to arbitrary code execution.
