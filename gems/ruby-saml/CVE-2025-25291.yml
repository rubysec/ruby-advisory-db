title: Ruby SAML allows a SAML authentication bypass due to DOCTYPE handling (parser differential)
date: 2025-03-12
description: |-
  ### Summary
  An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml due to a parser differential.
  ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers can generate entirely
  different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an attacker
  to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack.

  ### Impact
  This issue may lead to authentication bypass.
