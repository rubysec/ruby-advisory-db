title: Ruby-Saml Gem is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
date: 2015-02-03
description: |
  ruby-saml contains a flaw that is triggered as the URI value of a
  SAML response is not properly sanitized through a prepared statement.
  This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands
  on the host machine.
