title: foreman_kubevirt disables SSL verification if a Certificate
  Authority (CA) certificate is not explicitly set
date: 2026-02-02
description: |
  A flaw was found in foreman_kubevirt. When configuring the connection
  to OpenShift, the system disables SSL verification if a Certificate
  Authority (CA) certificate is not explicitly set. This insecure
  default allows a remote attacker, capable of intercepting network
  traffic between Satellite and OpenShift, to perform a Man-in-the-Middle
  (MITM) attack. Such an attack could lead to the disclosure or
  alteration of sensitive information.
