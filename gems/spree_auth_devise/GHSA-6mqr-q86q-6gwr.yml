title: Authentication Bypass by CSRF Weakness
date: 2021-11-18
description: "### Impact\n\nCSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.\n\nAll
  applications using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise`
  are affected if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:\n\n* Executed whether as:\n
  \ * A before_action callback (the default)\n  * A prepend_before_action (option
  prepend: true given) before the :load_object hook in Spree::UserController (most
  likely order to find).\n* Configured to use :null_session or :reset_session strategies
  (:null_session is the default in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new
  generated skeleton use :exception).\n\nThat means that applications that haven't
  been configured differently from what it's generated with Rails aren't affected.\n\nThanks
  @waiting-for-dev for reporting and providing a patch \U0001F44F \n\n### Patches\n\nSpree
  4.3 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.4.1\nSpree 4.2 users should update
  to spree_auth_devise 4.2.1\n \n### Workarounds\n\nIf possible, change your strategy
  to :exception:\n\n```ruby\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n
  \ protect_from_forgery with: :exception\nend\n```\n\nAdd the following to`config/application.rb
  `to at least run the `:exception` strategy on the affected controller:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.after_initialize
  do\n  Spree::UsersController.protect_from_forgery with: :exception\nend\n```\n\n###
