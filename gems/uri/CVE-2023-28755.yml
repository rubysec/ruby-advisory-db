title: Ruby URI component ReDoS issue
date: 2023-03-31
description: |
  A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component through 0.12.0 in
  Ruby through 3.2.1. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have
  specific characters. It causes an increase in execution time for parsing
  strings to URI objects. The fixed versions are 0.12.1, 0.11.1,
  0.10.2 and 0.10.0.1.
cvss_v3: 7.5
patched_versions:
  - "~> 0.10.0.1"
  - "~> 0.10.2"
  - "~> 0.11.1"
  - ">= 0.12.1"
