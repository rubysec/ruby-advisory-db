title: Potential XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails Applications
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  The cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention feature in Ruby on Rails 2.x
  before 2.3.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.8, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc2 does
  not properly handle mutation of safe buffers, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via crafted strings to an
  application that uses a problematic string method, as demonstrated
  by the sub method.
