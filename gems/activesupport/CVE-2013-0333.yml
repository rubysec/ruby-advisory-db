title: 'CVE-2013-0333 rubygem-activesupport: json to yaml parsing'
date: 2013-01-28
description: lib/active_support/json/backends/yaml.rb in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x before
  2.3.16 and 3.0.x before 3.0.20 does not properly convert JSON data to YAML data
  for processing by a YAML parser, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  code, conduct SQL injection attacks, or bypass authentication via crafted data that
  triggers unsafe decoding, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0156.
