title: Puppet uses predictable filenames, allowing arbitrary file overwrite
date: 2012-05-29
description: |
  Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.15 and 2.7.x before 2.7.13, and Puppet Enterprise
  (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.x, 2.0.x, and 2.5.x before 2.5.1 uses predictable file
  names when installing Mac OS X packages from a remote source, which allows local
  users to overwrite arbitrary files or install arbitrary packages via a symlink attack
  on a temporary file in /tmp.
