title: Insufficient input validation
date: 2017-10-24
description: |
  lib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and
  2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not
  properly restrict the characters in the Common Name field of a
  Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which makes it easier for
  user-assisted remote attackers to trick administrators into
  signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI control sequences.
