title: Vulnerability in aescrypt because IV is not randomized
date: 2013-10-01
description: |
  The aescrypt gem 1.0.0 for Ruby does not randomize the CBC IV for use with the
  AESCrypt.encrypt and AESCrypt.decrypt functions, which allows attackers to
  defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via a chosen plaintext attack.
cvss_v3: 7.5
