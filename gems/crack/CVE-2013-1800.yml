title: 'CVE-2013-1800 rubygem-crack: YAML parameter parsing vulnerability'
date: 2013-01-09
description: The crack gem 0.3.1 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
  of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection
  attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
  consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2)
  Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
