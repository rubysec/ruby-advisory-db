title: Possible ReDoS vulnerability in plain_text_for_blockquote_node
  in Action Text
date: 2024-10-15
description: |
  There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the
  plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper in Action Text. This
  vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-47888.

  ## Impact

  Carefully crafted text can cause the plain_text_for_blockquote_node
  helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting
  in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should
  either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.

  Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications
  using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends
  on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.

  ## Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  ## Workarounds

  Users can avoid calling `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` or
  upgrade to Ruby 3.2.
