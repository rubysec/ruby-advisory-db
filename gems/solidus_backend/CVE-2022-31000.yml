title: CSRF allows attacker to finalize/unfinalize order adjustments in solidus_backend
date: 2022-06-01
description: |
  ### Impact
  CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to change the state of an order's adjustments
  if they hold its number, and the execution happens on a store administrator's computer.

  Reproduction steps:
  - Take an order's number.
  - Log in as an administrator.
  - Visit that order's adjustments section (_Orders -> {Click on number} -> Adjustments_) and check that its adjustments are finalized (closed padlock under the **State** column).
  - On another tab, visit `{your_site_url}/admin/orders/{order_number}/adjustments/unfinalize`.
  - Notice how the adjustments are unfinalized (open padlock), even if the previous was a `GET` request which could have been linked from any other site.
  - Visit `{your_site_url}/admin/orders/{order_number}/adjustments/finalize`.
  - Notice how the adjustments are again finalized.

  That happened because both routes were handled as `GET` requests, which are skipped by Rails anti-forgery protection.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to solidus_backend v3.1.6, v3.0.6, or v2.11.16, depending on the major and minor versions in use.
