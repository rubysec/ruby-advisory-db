# Ruby Advisory Database

The Ruby Advisory Database is a community effort to compile all security
advisories that are relevant to Ruby libraries.

You can check your own Gemfile.locks against this database by using
[bundler-audit].

## Support Ruby Security!

Do you know about a vulnerability that isn't listed in this database? Open an
issue or submit a PR.

## Directory Structure

The database is a list of directories that match the names of Ruby libraries on
[rubygems.org]. Within each directory are one or more advisory files
for the Ruby library. These advisory files are named using
the advisories' [CVE] identifier number.

```
gems/:
  actionpack/:
    CVE-2014-0130.yml  CVE-2014-7818.yml  CVE-2014-7829.yml  CVE-2015-7576.yml
    CVE-2015-7581.yml  CVE-2016-0751.yml  CVE-2016-0752.yml
rubies/:
  jruby/:
    ...
  mruby/:
    ...
  ruby/:
    ...
```

### `gems/`

The `gems/` directory contains sub-directories that match the names of the Ruby
libraries on [rubygems.org]. Within each directory are one or more advisory
files for the Ruby library. These advisory files are named using the
advisories' [CVE] or [GHSA] ID.

### `rubies/`

The `rubies/` directory contains sub-directories for each Ruby implementation.
Within each directory are one or more advisory files for the Ruby
implementation. These advisory files are named using the advisories' [CVE]
or [GHSA] ID.

## Examples

Each advisory file contains the advisory information in [YAML] format.
Here are some example advisories:

### `gems/actionpack/CVE-2023-22795.yml`

```yaml
---
gem: actionpack
cve: 2023-22795
ghsa: 8xww-x3g3-6jcv
url: https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v7.0.4.1
title: ReDoS based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch
date: 2023-01-18
description: |
  There is a possible regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action
  Dispatch related to the If-None-Match header. This vulnerability has been
  assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22795.

  Versions Affected: All
  Not affected: None
  Fixed Versions: 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1

  # Impact

  A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause the regular
  expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a
  version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts
  of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running
  an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately.

  # Workarounds

  We recommend that all users upgrade to one of the FIXED versions. In the
  meantime, users can mitigate this vulnerability by using a load balancer or
  other device to filter out malicious If-None-Match headers before they reach
  the application.

  Users on Ruby 3.2.0 or greater are not affected by this vulnerability.
patched_versions:
  - "~> 5.2.8"
  - "~> 6.1.7, >= 6.1.7.1"
  - ">= 7.0.4.1"
```

### `rubies/ruby/CVE-2022-28739.yml`

```yaml
---
engine: ruby
cve: 2022-28739
url: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/04/12/buffer-overrun-in-string-to-float-cve-2022-28739/
title: Buffer overrun in String-to-Float conversion
date: 2022-04-12
description: |
  A buffer-overrun vulnerability is discovered in a conversion algorithm from a String to a Float. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28739. We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

  Due to a bug in an internal function that converts a String to a Float, some convertion methods like Kernel#Float and String#to_f could cause buffer over-read. A typical consequence is a process termination due to segmentation fault, but in a limited circumstances, it may be exploitable for illegal memory read.

  Please update Ruby to 2.6.10, 2.7.6, 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.
patched_versions:
  - ~> 2.6.10
  - ~> 2.7.6
  - ~> 3.0.4
  - '>= 3.1.2'
```

## Tests

Prior to submitting a pull request, run the tests:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

## GitHub Advisory Sync

There is a script that will create initial YAML files for RubyGem advisories
which are in the [GitHub Security Advisory API], but are not already in this
dataset. This script can be periodically run to ensure this repo has all the
data that is present in the GitHub Advisory data.

The GitHub Advisory API requires a token to access it.

* It can be a completely scope-less token (recommended); it does not require any
  permissions at all.
* Get yours at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

To run the GitHub Advisory sync to retrieve all advisories, start by executing
the rake task:

```shell
GH_API_TOKEN="your GitHub API Token" bundle exec rake sync_github_advisories
```

Or, to only retrieve advisories for a single gem:

```shell
GH_API_TOKEN="your GitHub API Token" bundle exec rake sync_github_advisories[gem_name]
```

* The rake task will write YAML files for any missing advisories.
* Those files must be further edited.
  * Fill in `cvss_v3` field by following the CVE link and getting it from page.
  * Fill in `cvss_v4` field by following the CVE link and getting it from page.
  * Fill in `patched_versions` field, using the comments at the bottom of the
    YAML file.
  * Optionally fill in `unaffected_versions`.
  * Delete the GitHub data at the bottom of the YAML file.
  * Double check all the data, commit it, and make a PR.
