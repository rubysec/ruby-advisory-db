title: Trusting FTP PASV responses vulnerability in Net::FTP
date: 2021-07-13
description: |
  A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP
  into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially
  makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise
  private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port
  scans and service banner extractions).
