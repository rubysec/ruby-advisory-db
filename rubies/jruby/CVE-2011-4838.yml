title: "CVE-2011-4838 jruby: hash table collisions DoS (oCERT-2011-003)"
date: 2011-12-27
description: |
  JRuby before 1.6.5.1 computes hash values without restricting the ability
  to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers
  to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application
  that maintains a hash table.
