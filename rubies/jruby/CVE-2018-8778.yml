title: Buffer under-read in String#unpack
date: 2018-04-03
description: |
  An attacker controlling the unpacking format (similar to format
  string vulnerabilities) can trigger a buffer under-read in the
  String#unpack method, resulting in a massive and controlled
  information disclosure.

  `String#unpack` receives format specifiers as its parameter, and can be
  specified the position of parsing the data by the specifier `@`. If a big
  number is passed with `@`, the number is treated as the negative value, and
  out-of-buffer read is occurred. So, if a script accepts an external input as
  the argument of `String#unpack`, the attacker can read data on heaps.

  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
