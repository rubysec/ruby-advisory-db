title: 'CVE-2012-5370 jruby: Murmur hash function collisions (oCERT-2012-001)'
date: 2012-11-23
description: JRuby computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to
  trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to
  cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application
  that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack
  against the MurmurHash2 algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4838.
