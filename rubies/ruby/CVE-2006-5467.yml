title: Denial of service vulnerabilities in the Ruby CGI
date: 2006-10-27
description: |
  The cgi.rb CGI library for Ruby 1.8 allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via
  an HTTP request with a multipart MIME body that contains an invalid
  boundary specifier, as demonstrated using a specifier that begins
  with a "-" instead of "--" and contains an inconsistent ID.
