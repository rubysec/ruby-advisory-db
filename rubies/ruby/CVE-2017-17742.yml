title: HTTP response splitting in WEBrick
date: 2018-03-28
description: |
  There is an HTTP response splitting vulnerability in WEBrick bundled with Ruby.

  If a script accepts an external input and outputs it without modification as
  a part of HTTP responses, an attacker can use newline characters to deceive
  the clients that the HTTP response header is stopped at there, and can inject
  fake HTTP responses after the newline characters to show malicious contents
  to the clients.

  All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
