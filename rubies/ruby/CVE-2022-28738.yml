title: Double free in Regexp compilation
date: 2022-04-12
description: |
  A double-free vulnerability is discovered in Regexp compilation. This
  vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28738.
  We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

  Due to a bug in the Regexp compilation process, creating a Regexp
  object with a crafted source string could cause the same memory to
  be freed twice. This is known as a “double free” vulnerability. Note
  that, in general, it is considered unsafe to create and use a Regexp
  object generated from untrusted input. In this case, however,
  following a comprehensive assessment, we treat this issue as a vulnerability.

  Please update Ruby to 3.0.4 or 3.1.2.
