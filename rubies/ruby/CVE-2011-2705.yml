title: Ruby Random Number Generation Local Denial Of Service Vulnerability
date: 2011-07-02
description: |
  The SecureRandom.random_bytes function in lib/securerandom.rb in Ruby before
  1.8.7-p352 and 1.9.x before 1.9.2-p290 relies on PID values for
  initialization, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
  predict the result string by leveraging knowledge of random strings obtained
  in an earlier process with the same PID.
