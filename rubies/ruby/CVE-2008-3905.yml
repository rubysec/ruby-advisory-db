title: ruby -- DNS spoofing vulnerability in resolv.rb

description: |
  resolv.rb in Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p287, 1.8.7 before
  1.8.7-p72, and 1.9 r18423 and earlier uses sequential transaction IDs and
  constant source ports for DNS requests, which makes it easier for remote

  CVE-2008-1447.
