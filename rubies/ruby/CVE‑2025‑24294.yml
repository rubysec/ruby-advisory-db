title: Possible Denial of Service in resolv gem
date: 2025-07-08
description: |
  A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the `resolv` gem bundled with Ruby.

  The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.
  An attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet,
  the name-decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.
  This resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.
