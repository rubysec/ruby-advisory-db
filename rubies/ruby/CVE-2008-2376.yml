title: More ruby integer overflows (rb_ary_fill / Array#fill)
date: 2008-06-30
description: |
  Integer overflow in the rb_ary_fill function in array.c in Ruby before
  revision 17756 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
  service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call to the
  Array#fill method with a start (aka beg) argument greater than ARY_MAX_SIZE.
  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for other closely
  related integer overflows.
