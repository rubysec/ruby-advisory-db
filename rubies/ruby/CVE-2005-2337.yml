title: Security Bypass Vulnerability with Ruby
date: 2005-10-07
description: |
  The Ruby language has a security mechanism (security model) that
  can restrict operations on untrusted objects. This security model
  is based on mechanisms called "object taint" and "safe level."
  A vulnerability has been confirmed that allows arbitrary script
  execution by bypassing the "safe level" setting and taint
  flag protections and execute disallowed code when Ruby
  processes a program through standard input (stdin).
