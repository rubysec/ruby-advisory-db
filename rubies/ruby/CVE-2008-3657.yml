title: Ruby missing "taintness" checks in dl module
date: 2008-08-08
description: |
  The dl module in Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-p286, 1.8.7
  through 1.8.7-p71, and 1.9 through r18423 does not check "taintness" of
  inputs, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass safe levels and
  execute dangerous functions by accessing a library using DL.dlopen.
cvss_v2: 7.5
patched_versions:
  - "~> 1.8.6.287"
  - "~> 1.8.7.72"
