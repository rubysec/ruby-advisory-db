title: Ruby multiple insufficient safe mode restrictions
date: 2008-08-08
description: |
  Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-p286, 1.8.7 through 1.8.7-p71,
  and 1.9 through r18423 does not properly restrict access to critical
  variables and methods at various safe levels, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via (1) untrace_var, (2)
  $PROGRAM_NAME, and (3) syslog at safe level 4, and (4) insecure methods at
  safe levels 1 through 3.
cvss_v2: 7.5
