title: 'CVE-2011-3389 HTTPS: block-wise chosen-plaintext attack against SSL/TLS (BEAST)'
date: 2011-08-31
description: The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows
  and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other
  products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which
  allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise
  chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript
  code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3)
  the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.
