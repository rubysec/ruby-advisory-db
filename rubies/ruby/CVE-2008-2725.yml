date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  Integer overflow in the (1) rb_ary_splice function in Ruby 1.8.4
  and earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230,
  and 1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22; and (2) the rb_ary_replace function
  in 1.6.x allows context-dependent attackers to trigger memory
  corruption via unspecified vectors, aka the "REALLOC_N" variant,
  a different issue than CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, and CVE-2008-2664.
