title: Buffer overrun in String-to-Float conversion
date: 2022-04-12
description: |
  A buffer-overrun vulnerability is discovered in a conversion algorithm from a String to a Float. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28739. We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

  Due to a bug in an internal function that converts a String to a Float, some convertion methods like Kernel#Float and String#to_f could cause buffer over-read. A typical consequence is a process termination due to segmentation fault, but in a limited circumstances, it may be exploitable for illegal memory read.

  Please update Ruby to 2.6.10, 2.7.6, 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.
