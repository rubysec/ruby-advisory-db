  Various methods in WEBrick::HTTPRequest in Ruby
  1.9.2-p290 and 1.8.7-p352 and earlier do not validate the
  X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server headers in
  requests, which might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary text
  into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a crafted header.
