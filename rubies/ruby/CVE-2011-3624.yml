title: WEBrick::HTTPRequest X-Forwarded-* allows arbitrary data
date: 2019-11-25
description: |
  Various methods in WEBrick::HTTPRequest do not validate the
  X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server headers in
  requests, which might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary text
  into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a crafted header.

  - Ruby 3.0.0 was the release when webrick was moved into a separate gem.
  - Did not find references to 1.8.7 fix.
  - Found this in above 1.9.2 ChangeLog. Unclear if connected.

       * lib/webrick/httprequest.rb (setup_forwarded_info): Parsing request
         header failed when the request is from 2 or more Apache reverse
         proxies. It's said that all X-Forwarded-* headers will contain more
        than one (comma-separated) value if the original request already
        contained one of these headers.  Since we could use these values as
        Host header, we choose the initial(first) value. See #4922.
