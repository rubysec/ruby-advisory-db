title: WEBrick::HTTPRequest X-Forwarded-* allows arbitrary data
date: 2019-11-25
description: |
  Various methods in WEBrick::HTTPRequest do not validate the
  X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server headers in
  requests, which might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary text
  into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a crafted header.
