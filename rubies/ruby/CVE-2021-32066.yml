title: imap - StartTLS stripping attack
date: 2021-08-01
description: |
  An issue was discovered in Ruby through
  2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1.
  Net::IMAP does not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with
  an an unknown response, which might allow man-in-the-middle
  attackers to bypass the TLS protections by leveraging a network
  position between the client and the registry to block the
  StartTLS command, aka a "StartTLS stripping attack."
