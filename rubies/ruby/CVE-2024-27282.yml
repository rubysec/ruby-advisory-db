title: Arbitrary memory address read vulnerability with Regex search
date: 2024-04-23
description: |
  If attacker-supplied data is provided to the Ruby regex compiler, it is
  possible to extract arbitrary heap data relative to the start of the text,
  including pointers and sensitive strings.

  We recommend to update the Ruby to version 3.3.1 or later. In order to ensure compatibility with older Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:

  * For Ruby 3.0 users: Update to 3.0.7
  * For Ruby 3.1 users: Update to 3.1.5
  * For Ruby 3.2 users: Update to 3.2.4
  * For Ruby 3.3 users: Update to 3.3.1
cvss_v3: 6.6
patched_versions:
  - "~> 3.0.7"
  - "~> 3.1.5"
  - "~> 3.2.4"
