title: Null pointer dereference in mrb_class
date: 2018-06-12
description: |
  An issue was discovered in mruby 1.4.1. There is a NULL pointer
  dereference in mrb_class, related to certain .clone usage, because
  mrb_obj_clone in kernel.c copies flags other than the
  MRB_FLAG_IS_FROZEN flag (e.g., the embedded flag).
