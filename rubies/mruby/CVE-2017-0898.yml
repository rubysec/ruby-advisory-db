title: Buffer underrun vulnerability in Kernel.sprintf
date: 2017-09-14
description: |
  There is a buffer underrun vulnerability in the sprintf
  method of Kernel module.

  If a malicious format string which contains a precious specifier (*) is
  passed and a huge minus value is also passed to the specifier, buffer
  underrun may be caused. In such situation, the result may contains heap,
  or the Ruby interpreter may crash.
